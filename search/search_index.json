Child protection prevention and response mechanisms responses must be established from the start of an intervention, or children's lives and well-being will be put at risk. The most important outcomes of child protection are to prevent violence, abuse and exploitation, and to ensure all children access to protection services, by establishing or supporting national and community-level child protection systems. _This policy details our Foundation's commitment to Child protection. _ Definitions \u00b6 GE / the Foundation Grassroots Economics, a registered Foundation. Child Persons who are under 18 years of age UASC Unaccompanied and separated children WFCL Worst forms of child labour e.g. illicit work, work that harms their health, safety or morals Discrimination Treating an individual and/or group of people less well because of whom or what they are. CRC Convention for Rights of the Child BIP Best Interest Procedures BIA Best Interest Assessment SOP Standard Operation Procedures Protection Objectives \u00b6 Priority objectives during the first phase of an intervention: To ensure that girls and boys are safe where they live, learn and play. To strengthen the capacity of children to participate in their own protection. To give girls and boys child-friendly access to asylum, refugee and other legal procedures, and to essential documents. To ensure that girls and boys with specific needs receive targeted support. Guiding Principles Best interest of the child For all decisions related to a child, the best interest of this child should be considered first and foremost. Each child\u2019s best interest should be considered as an individual Non-discrimination All children are equally entitled to all of the rights in the convention. No child should be discriminated on the basis of gender, age, ethnicity, race, religion, physical abilities, etc Participation Children are no longer considered just property of their parents; nor are they passive recipients of charity. Children are active rights claimants. Children have the right to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. Survival and Development Children\u2019s mental, emotional and physical development are interlinked. All rights of children must be realized. Standards and Frameworks The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sphere, Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action , and its core principles and standards for child protection work (see the diagram below). Rights-based approaches, including age, gender, and diversity mainstreaming (AGD). The InterAgency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated Children \ufeff The Children Act (2012) of Kenya These principles provide definitions and key standards and principles for preventing and responding to family separation, and on working with unaccompanied and separated children. We fully suport the Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action Risks Affecting Children Lack of access to asylum procedures or procedures that are child-friendly. If asylum processes are not child sensitive, children may not be able to exercise their right to seek asylum, or may be put in a position where they are easily exploited by adults. Separation from parents and caregivers. Children can become separated from their parents and caregivers before or during flight or while in displacement. They can be sent away, abandoned, or encouraged to live alone (because, for example, their carers believe they will receive more support). UASC are often particularly at risk of violence, exploitation, abuse or neglect. Sexual violence and sexual exploitation. Displaced children are particularly at risk of sexual violence and exploitation. A high proportion of survivors of sexual violence are girls, but boys are also affected. Mental disorders and psychosocial distress. In contexts of forced displacement, children are exposed to traumatic events as well as high levels of daily stress. Without adequate support, many are likely to develop health issues. Children associated with armed forces and armed groups. Refugee and displaced children, especially adolescents who are not in school, may be recruited by armed forces and armed groups. Such children are often exposed to extreme violence and may be abused, exploited, injured or killed. Trafficking, smuggling, sale and illegal adoption, inappropriate adoption. Displaced children may be targeted for trafficking, smuggling, sale and illegal adoption. UASC are particularly at risk. Physical violence and harmful practices. In displacement, children are at increased risk of domestic violence, abuse and corporal punishment, because their families are under acute strain and community protection mechanisms are disrupted. In their efforts to cope, families may adopt harmful practices, and children may adopt negative coping mechanisms, including substance abuse. Child labour. When families lose their income and assets, children are more likely to become involved in the worst forms of child labour (WFCL), such as forced or bonded labour. Children may be used in armed conflicts, trafficked for exploitative work or sexual exploitation, engaged in illicit work, or forced to do work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Dangers and injuries. Children living in insecure or unsafe conditions are at greater risk of injury and disability. When they are in, or travel through, conflict zones, for example, they risk injury from unexploded ordnance and landmines. Detention. Particularly in the context of political conflicts, children who participate in political activities (or are perceived to have participated in them) are commonly detained. Children seeking asylum may also be detained. Especially when they are held in facilities alongside adults, children in detention are at risk of psychological, physical and sexual abuse and other harms to their development. Best Practices in Policy and Decision making When discussing either the Best Interest of the Child or the Welfare Principle emphasis must be placed on three main applications: Government policy making (Government Decisions), Program design (Programming Decisions) and Decisions made about children on an individual basis (Individual Decisions). The Best Interest of a Child relates to our DECISION MAKING process with regards to children\u2019s rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes. Policy Decisions International Humanitarian Organizations and the Kenya Children Act (2012) requires projects to analyze how each course of action may affect children. Because the interests of children are not always identical to adults' interests, and can at times even conflict, GE must carefully separate out the various interests at stake. The government does not have to take the course of action that is best for children, but if any conflicts are identified, GE must make the \" best interests \" of children \" a primary consideration .\" This rule applies in budget allocations, in the making of laws, and in the administration of the government. Program Decisions: Similar to how the government must create policies for the protection of all children in the state, organizations designing programs or making programming decisions on behalf of all children in a program location must do so considering how the rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes will be affected on a broad scale. Therefore, rather than look at an individual child, organizations will assess a given population and design programs that will benefit this entire population. For example, an organization may design an awareness raising campaign on the reintegration of former child soldiers. The program itself is not targeting any one child, but intends to bring awareness to support all former child soldiers. Participants should understand that the design of their activities can have an impact on an individual child or groups of children depending on how the activity is planned and implemented. In addition, how they respond (identify, report, refer, followup) to child protection cases must be carefully thought through on the basis of the Best Interest of the Child with careful evaluation to ensure that decisions are not solely made in the interest of the parent, the agency responding, or sometimes even the child\u2019s own wishes. Procedure to ensure non-discrimination The Human Rights committee defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing of all rights and freedoms. According to the CRC, Article 2 states that, \u2015States shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parents or legal guardian\u2019s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth and status. In other words, every child within a State\u2019s jurisdiction holds all CRC rights without regard to citizenship, immigration status or any other status. Refugee children, asylum seekers, and rejected asylum seekers are entitled to all rights of the CRC. States parties should take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs of a child\u2019s guardians or family members. Program design for Child Protection Are there Groups of boys and girls discriminated against: (Question: Who is discriminated against?) Children with disabilities Child Soldiers Children affected by HIV/AIDS Street Children Working Children Orphans Reasons for Discrimination: (Question: Why are they being discriminated against?) Poverty and other economic reasons Traditional/Cultural beliefs and practices Lack of education Lack of awareness Family environment Sex Discrimination Behavior: (Question: What is the result of the discrimination?) Limited opportunities (limited access to education) Limited scope of participation Inheritance law Abuse Family values boys over girls The program should ensure that the above are taken into consideration and that no child is discriminated against in the intervention.It is vital that protection of children is prioritised. These should determine programme design, alongside factors such as the number of children at risk, and assistance and protection services that are already operational. It is important to continuously monitor and analyse the nature and scale of risks to children, the capacity of populations of concern and the child protection system to address those risks. Key Steps in Child Protection Analyse child protection needs and capacities and plan the response Assess child protection needs and risks and prioritise them in terms of severity and scale. Base initial assessments on pre-crisis and secondary data, and that risks for children are prevalent even if there is no data to substantiate this. Consider what further information is needed. This can be collected by including child protection questions and issues in initial rapid needs assessments (within 1 \u2013 3 weeks), or specifically assessing child protection concerns (within 4-6 weeks, ongoing as required). Assess the capacity of the child protection system, of GE, partners, and other key actors. Look for ways to connect with and build on existing capacity. Monitor and report on child protection issues and violations. There is a specific obligation to monitor and report on grave violations against children. Identify gaps in GE capacity and the need for dedicated child protection staff. Review the percentage of children in the population and the severity of the child protection risks. Consider asking GE to deploy additional child protection personnel and provide expert guidance. Establish or strengthen coordination mechanisms for child protection. To start with, focus on technical and strategic guidance, identifying gaps, and ensuring that services are not duplicated. Develop a capacity building strategy for volunteers, partners, Government and different categories of GE staff. GE is often able to support capacity building technically. Consider coaching, mentoring, self-learning, and other methods in addition to training, and tie training to performance outcomes. Establish mechanisms to identify, prioritise, assess and refer children at risk At registration Include clear guidelines and screening questionsin the registration procedures that will identify vulnerable children. Assign child protection staff to registration points and establish a child protection desk. Establish referral pathways and criteria for prioritizing identified children at risk. Prioritization should be based on an evaluation of exposure to risk, and referral pathways should be part of the operation's best interests procedure for children at risk. As soon as possible, train registration and other key staff to identify and refer children at risk, and in how to communicate with children. Ensure registration environments and processes are child-friendly, including providing communication material and information that are accessible to children of different ages and abilities. At camp / site / city level Set up a functioning best interests procedure (BIP) and ensure that enough GE and partner staff are available for implementation. Agree on prioritisation criteria, referral pathways, and BIP Standard Operating Procedures (i.e. SOPs for case management) of children at risk. As part of the BIP, establish clear roles, responsibilities and mechanisms to ensure that Best Interest Assessments (BIAs) are systematically conducted for UASC and other children at risk. Information recorded in relation to cases of individual children at risk should be stored securely and confidentially using the Child Protection Module in proGres V4 wherever this is in use. The Child Protection Information Management System or other systems may be used by some partners, in which case GE will need to find ways to share information appropriately. Ensure that asylum and assistance procedures are child-friendly, for example by consulting children on GE and partner procedures and integrating their feedback, and providing information to children in a format that they can understand. 3. Prevent, and respond to, separation of children from parents and caregivers Put in place measures to prevent separation during arrival, relocation and evacuations. (Ensure families are kept together, do not transfer children alone without screening first, etc.) Ensure that assistance procedures do not encourage deliberate separation (for example by targeting UASC, or encouraging families to split in order to receive additional assistance). Ensure that mechanisms are in place to identify, refer, document, trace and reunify children. Coordinate with ICRC and national Red Cross/Crescent Societies. Support or establish tracing activities (community-based tracing mechanisms, listening posts, children's desks, phone calls, progress searches, etc.), as necessary. Ensure that Best Interests Procedure is in place for all children who require tracing and reunification. (See the Entry on Best Interests Procedures \ufeff.) 4. Ensure adequate alternative care services Seek to understand traditional care strategies for UASC (including potential protection risks linked to these). Assess the capacity of the community to absorb children that need care, and the complementary support that is potentially required.Complementary support be based on the family's vulnerability rather than the fact that the family is caring for UASC, so as to prevent deliberate separation in the hope of assistance. Conduct BIA for all children who are considered for, or who are in, alternative care. If numbers are high, prioritize younger children and unaccompanied children. Identify a range of alternative care options for children in different situations. Prioritize younger children for family-based care, and keep siblings together. Options are likely to include foster care, and supported/supervised independent living for older children or child-headed households, for whom family-based care has been explored and proven to be unfeasible. Residential care arrangements in family-like settings may be considered if the community's foster-care capacity is overwhelmed. Institutional care should be a last resort and for the shortest possible time. Mobilize community leaders and community-based organizations (such as foster parents' associations) to support alternative care. 5. Provide psychosocial support for children, parents and caregivers Provide parents and caregivers with information on child psychosocial distress, and on how they can support their children to recover, as well as access services. Establish regular structured recreational activities, led by community volunteers, and coordinate these with education activities. This may include child friendly spaces, ensuring that age and gender-sensitive activities are developed and implemented for teenagers. Ensure that psychosocial support activities link to and support safe emergency education of good quality. Work with other sectors to ensure that they consider the protection and wellbeing of children. Assist them to make their services child-friendly and accessible. 6. Prevent and respond to sexual violence and exploitation Ensure that measures to prevent sexual violence and sexual exploitation include children (for example, by identifying risk factors specific to children). Ensure that response and referral mechanisms are adapted to the needs of children and link to Best Interests Procedure (including, but not limited to, alternative care, BIP) where necessary. Provide information on access to services and child protection. Make information child-friendly. Access to information helps to prevent sexual exploitation. Put in place immediate safety and security measures. These include policing and emergency lighting at displacement sites, and screening procedures at points of entry to and departure from affected areas, to prevent abductions, trafficking and violence, and accommodating child-headed households close to vetted community households. 7. Strengthen community-based child protection mechanisms and national child protection system Identify community-based mechanisms, traditions and practices that contribute to the protection of children. Identify, training and mobilise resource people who can identify and refer protection risks and children at risk. Promote community-led initiatives to strengthen the protective environment (awareness-raising, referrals, follow-up of children at risk, etc.). Map the structure, capacity and procedures of the national child protection system, degree to which children of concern to GE have access to these, and support needs. Work with national authorities and UNICEF at the national level and the field to strengthen capacity, quality and responsiveness of the national system, and advocate to ensure children of concern have non-dissimilatory access. 8. Prevent recruitment and support the release and reintegration of children associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG) Ensure screening and identification procedures are in place for CAAFAG and that procedures for ex-combatants are child-sensitive. Do not detain children unless absolutely necessary. If detention is unavoidable, detain children separately, and avoid separating siblings. As a prevention and response strategy in all contexts, ensure that children have access to psychosocial, educational, livelihood and recreational activities that are not stigmatizing.","title":"Child Protection Policy"},{"location":"commons/child_policy/#grassroots-economics-foundations-child-protection-policy-and-proceedures","text":"Note about this policy template: Grassroots Economic Foundation recognizes child protection is a life-saving priority.

When families lose their income and assets, children are more likely to become involved in the worst forms of child labour (WFCL), such as forced or bonded labour. Children may be used in armed conflicts, trafficked for exploitative work or sexual exploitation, engaged in illicit work, or forced to do work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Dangers and injuries. Children living in insecure or unsafe conditions are at greater risk of injury and disability. When they are in, or travel through, conflict zones, for example, they risk injury from unexploded ordnance and landmines. Detention. Particularly in the context of political conflicts, children who participate in political activities (or are perceived to have participated in them) are commonly detained. Children seeking asylum may also be detained. Especially when they are held in facilities alongside adults, children in detention are at risk of psychological, physical and sexual abuse and other harms to their development. Best Practices in Policy and Decision making When discussing either the Best Interest of the Child or the Welfare Principle emphasis must be placed on three main applications: Government policy making (Government Decisions), Program design (Programming Decisions) and Decisions made about children on an individual basis (Individual Decisions). The Best Interest of a Child relates to our DECISION MAKING process with regards to children\u2019s rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes. Policy Decisions International Humanitarian Organizations and the Kenya Children Act (2012) requires projects to analyze how each course of action may affect children. Because the interests of children are not always identical to adults' interests, and can at times even conflict, GE must carefully separate out the various interests at stake. The government does not have to take the course of action that is best for children, but if any conflicts are identified, GE must make the \" best interests \" of children \" a primary consideration .\" This rule applies in budget allocations, in the making of laws, and in the administration of the government. Program Decisions: Similar to how the government must create policies for the protection of all children in the state, organizations designing programs or making programming decisions on behalf of all children in a program location must do so considering how the rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes will be affected on a broad scale. Therefore, rather than look at an individual child, organizations will assess a given population and design programs that will benefit this entire population. For example, an organization may design an awareness raising campaign on the reintegration of former child soldiers. The program itself is not targeting any one child, but intends to bring awareness to support all former child soldiers. Participants should understand that the design of their activities can have an impact on an individual child or groups of children depending on how the activity is planned and implemented. In addition, how they respond (identify, report, refer, followup) to child protection cases must be carefully thought through on the basis of the Best Interest of the Child with careful evaluation to ensure that decisions are not solely made in the interest of the parent, the agency responding, or sometimes even the child\u2019s own wishes. Procedure to ensure non-discrimination The Human Rights committee defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing of all rights and freedoms. According to the CRC, Article 2 states that, \u2015States shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parents or legal guardian\u2019s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth and status. In other words, every child within a State\u2019s jurisdiction holds all CRC rights without regard to citizenship, immigration status or any other status. Refugee children, asylum seekers, and rejected asylum seekers are entitled to all rights of the CRC. States parties should take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs of a child\u2019s guardians or family members. Program design for Child Protection Are there Groups of boys and girls discriminated against: (Question: Who is discriminated against?) Children with disabilities Child Soldiers Children affected by HIV/AIDS Street Children Working Children Orphans Reasons for Discrimination: (Question: Why are they being discriminated against?) Poverty and other economic reasons Traditional/Cultural beliefs and practices Lack of education Lack of awareness Family environment Sex Discrimination Behavior: (Question: What is the result of the discrimination?) Limited opportunities (limited access to education) Limited scope of participation Inheritance law Abuse Family values boys over girls The program should ensure that the above are taken into consideration and that no child is discriminated against in the intervention.It is vital that protection of children is prioritised. These should determine programme design, alongside factors such as the number of children at risk, and assistance and protection services that are already operational. It is important to continuously monitor and analyse the nature and scale of risks to children, the capacity of populations of concern and the child protection system to address those risks. Key Steps in Child Protection Analyse child protection needs and capacities and plan the response Assess child protection needs and risks and prioritise them in terms of severity and scale. Base initial assessments on pre-crisis and secondary data, and that risks for children are prevalent even if there is no data to substantiate this. Consider what further information is needed. This can be collected by including child protection questions and issues in initial rapid needs assessments (within 1 \u2013 3 weeks), or specifically assessing child protection concerns (within 4-6 weeks, ongoing as required). Assess the capacity of the child protection system, of GE, partners, and other key actors. Look for ways to connect with and build on existing capacity. Monitor and report on child protection issues and violations. There is a specific obligation to monitor and report on grave violations against children. Identify gaps in GE capacity and the need for dedicated child protection staff. Review the percentage of children in the population and the severity of the child protection risks. Consider asking GE to deploy additional child protection personnel and provide expert guidance. Establish or strengthen coordination mechanisms for child protection. To start with, focus on technical and strategic guidance, identifying gaps, and ensuring that services are not duplicated. Develop a capacity building strategy for volunteers, partners, Government and different categories of GE staff. GE is often able to support capacity building technically. Consider coaching, mentoring, self-learning, and other methods in addition to training, and tie training to performance outcomes. Establish mechanisms to identify, prioritise, assess and refer children at risk At registration Include clear guidelines and screening questionsin the registration procedures that will identify vulnerable children. Assign child protection staff to registration points and establish a child protection desk. Establish referral pathways and criteria for prioritizing identified children at risk. Prioritization should be based on an evaluation of exposure to risk, and referral pathways should be part of the operation's best interests procedure for children at risk. As soon as possible, train registration and other key staff to identify and refer children at risk, and in how to communicate with children. Ensure registration environments and processes are child-friendly, including providing communication material and information that are accessible to children of different ages and abilities. At camp / site / city level Set up a functioning best interests procedure (BIP) and ensure that enough GE and partner staff are available for implementation. Agree on prioritisation criteria, referral pathways, and BIP Standard Operating Procedures (i.e. SOPs for case management) of children at risk. As part of the BIP, establish clear roles, responsibilities and mechanisms to ensure that Best Interest Assessments (BIAs) are systematically conducted for UASC and other children at risk. Information recorded in relation to cases of individual children at risk should be stored securely and confidentially using the Child Protection Module in proGres V4 wherever this is in use. The Child Protection Information Management System or other systems may be used by some partners, in which case GE will need to find ways to share information appropriately. Ensure that asylum and assistance procedures are child-friendly, for example by consulting children on GE and partner procedures and integrating their feedback, and providing information to children in a format that they can understand. 3. Prevent, and respond to, separation of children from parents and caregivers Put in place measures to prevent separation during arrival, relocation and evacuations. (Ensure families are kept together, do not transfer children alone without screening first, etc.) Ensure that assistance procedures do not encourage deliberate separation (for example by targeting UASC, or encouraging families to split in order to receive additional assistance). Ensure that mechanisms are in place to identify, refer, document, trace and reunify children. Coordinate with ICRC and national Red Cross/Crescent Societies. Support or establish tracing activities (community-based tracing mechanisms, listening posts, children's desks, phone calls, progress searches, etc.), as necessary. Ensure that Best Interests Procedure is in place for all children who require tracing and reunification. (See the Entry on Best Interests Procedures \ufeff.) 4. Ensure adequate alternative care services Seek to understand traditional care strategies for UASC (including potential protection risks linked to these). Assess the capacity of the community to absorb children that need care, and the complementary support that is potentially required.Complementary support be based on the family's vulnerability rather than the fact that the family is caring for UASC, so as to prevent deliberate separation in the hope of assistance. Conduct BIA for all children who are considered for, or who are in, alternative care. If numbers are high, prioritize younger children and unaccompanied children. Identify a range of alternative care options for children in different situations. Prioritize younger children for family-based care, and keep siblings together. Options are likely to include foster care, and supported/supervised independent living for older children or child-headed households, for whom family-based care has been explored and proven to be unfeasible. Residential care arrangements in family-like settings may be considered if the community's foster-care capacity is overwhelmed. Institutional care should be a last resort and for the shortest possible time. Mobilize community leaders and community-based organizations (such as foster parents' associations) to support alternative care. 5. Provide psychosocial support for children, parents and caregivers Provide parents and caregivers with information on child psychosocial distress, and on how they can support their children to recover, as well as access services. Establish regular structured recreational activities, led by community volunteers, and coordinate these with education activities. This may include child friendly spaces, ensuring that age and gender-sensitive activities are developed and implemented for teenagers. Ensure that psychosocial support activities link to and support safe emergency education of good quality. Work with other sectors to ensure that they consider the protection and wellbeing of children. Assist them to make their services child-friendly and accessible. 6. Prevent and respond to sexual violence and exploitation Ensure that measures to prevent sexual violence and sexual exploitation include children (for example, by identifying risk factors specific to children). Ensure that response and referral mechanisms are adapted to the needs of children and link to Best Interests Procedure (including, but not limited to, alternative care, BIP) where necessary. Provide information on access to services and child protection. Make information child-friendly. Access to information helps to prevent sexual exploitation. Put in place immediate safety and security measures. These include policing and emergency lighting at displacement sites, and screening procedures at points of entry to and departure from affected areas, to prevent abductions, trafficking and violence, and accommodating child-headed households close to vetted community households. 7. Strengthen community-based child protection mechanisms and national child protection system Identify community-based mechanisms, traditions and practices that contribute to the protection of children. Identify, training and mobilise resource people who can identify and refer protection risks and children at risk. Promote community-led initiatives to strengthen the protective environment (awareness-raising, referrals, follow-up of children at risk, etc.). Map the structure, capacity and procedures of the national child protection system, degree to which children of concern to GE have access to these, and support needs. Work with national authorities and UNICEF at the national level and the field to strengthen capacity, quality and responsiveness of the national system, and advocate to ensure children of concern have non-dissimilatory access. 8. Prevent recruitment and support the release and reintegration of children associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG) Ensure screening and identification procedures are in place for CAAFAG and that procedures for ex-combatants are child-sensitive. Do not detain children unless absolutely necessary. If detention is unavoidable, detain children separately, and avoid separating siblings. As a prevention and response strategy in all contexts, ensure that children have access to psychosocial, educational, livelihood and recreational activities that are not stigmatizing.","title":"Protection Objectives"},{"location":"commons/data_policy/","text":"Grassroots Economics Foundation's Data Protection Policy \u00b6 Note about this policy: Protecting individuals\u2019 Personal Data is an integral part of protecting their life, integrity and dignity. The right to privacy has long been recognized globally as a human right, while the right to Personal Data protection is a relatively recent human right that is closely connected to the right to privacy and sets forth conditions for the Processing of data of an identified or identifiable individual. This is why Personal Data protection is of fundamental importance for Humanitarian Organizations like us. This policy details our Foundations commitment to Data protection and privacy. Grassroots Economics recognizes and does comply with GDPR and its rights, except as limited. We make it as easy as possible to exercise most rights directly from your account. Users may contact us at privacy@grassecon.org to exercise their GDPR rights. Definitions \u00b6 GE / the Foundation Grassroots Economics Foundation, a registered non-profit GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation Responsible Person GE HR department Register of Systems GE IT Department PII Personal Identifying Information 1. Data protection principles \u00b6 The Foundation is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR. Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals; collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes; adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed; accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay; kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage,using appropriate technical or organisational measures.\u201d 2. General provisions \u00b6 This policy applies to all personal data processed by the Foundation. The Responsible Person shall take responsibility for the Foundation\u2019s ongoing compliance with this policy. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually. The Foundation shall adhere to the Data Protection Act of 2019 which was assented to by the President of the Republic of Kenya on 08 November 2019 (the \"Act\" ). The Foundation will ensure to have all the appropriate licenses/permits required for the handling of personal information The Foundation shall ensure all staff have read and signed the Data Protection & Privacy policy The Foundation will ensure that in the case of personal data being shared to external parties; that they are informed and instructed on adequate methods of Data Handling to ensure safety and dignity of individuals. In the case of Humanitarian aid ie. cash transfers being dependent on data collection; It would therefore not be necessary to inform all individuals of the conditions of data collection prior to receiving aid, if this would seriously hamper, delay or prevent the distribution of aid. Rather, the Humanitarian Organizations involved could provide such information in a less targeted and individualized way with public notices, or individually at a later stage. 3. Lawful, fair and transparent processing \u00b6 To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, the Foundation shall maintain a Register of Systems. The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to the foundation shall be dealt with in a timely manner. The Foundation shall always inform the individuals whose PII data is being shared. 4. Lawful purposes \u00b6 All data processed by the foundation must be done on one of the following lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests ( see Kenya Data Protection Act Guideline ). The Foundation shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in consent shall be kept with the personal data. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the Foundation\u2019s systems. 5. Data minimisation \u00b6 The Foundation shall ensure that personal data are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. 6. Sensitive Data \u00b6 Sensitive Data means Personal Data (aka Personal Identifying Information (PII)), which if disclosed, may result in discrimination or violence against or the repression of an individual. Typically, data relating to health, race or ethnicity, religious/political/armed group affiliation, or genetic and biometric data are considered to be Sensitive Data. All Sensitive Data requires augmented protection. Given the environments in which Humanitarian Organizations work and the possibility that various data elements that we handle may give rise to discrimination, setting out a definitive list of Sensitive Data categories. For example, in some situations, a simple list of names may be very sensitive, if it puts the individuals on the list and/or their families at risk of persecution. Equally, in other situations, data collected to respond to Humanitarian Emergencies may need to include data that in a regular data protection context would be considered to be Sensitive Data and the Processing of such data would be, in principle, prohibited, but in the local culture and the specific circumstances may be relatively harmless. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the sensitivity of data and the appropriate safeguards to protect Sensitive Data (e.g. technical and organizational security measures) on a case-by-case basis. 7. Accuracy \u00b6 The Foundation shall take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate. Note that the majority of PII data is user generated and optional. Where necessary for the lawful basis on which data is processed, steps shall be put in place to ensure that personal data is kept up to date. Data shall be collected in accordance with the Handbook on Data Protection and Humanitarian Action by ICRC 8. Archiving / removal \u00b6 To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than necessary, the Foundation shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which personal data is processed and review this process annually. The archiving policy shall consider what data should/must be retained, for how long, and why. (Various partners require records for 10 years) 9. Security \u00b6 The Foundation shall ensure that personal data is stored securely using modern software that is kept-up-to-date. An annual security audit should be carried out to test the Register of Systems integrity Access to personal data shall be limited to personnel who need access and appropriate security should be in place to avoid unauthorised sharing of information. When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place. 10. Breach \u00b6 In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, the Foundation shall promptly assess the risk to people\u2019s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach to the appropriate parties. 11. Training \u00b6 Regular staff training will be conducted to ensure individuals are sensitive to the latest Data Protection legislation and are aware of sensitive data, its collection and processing. 12. Data Stored and Classifications \u00b6 The following data are stored by the Foundation. Note that data that contitutes non-public identifying information (non-PII) as well as information users have chosen to share publicaly is considered non-confidential. Data Type Description Classification Instrument Data Mandatory All public information about the details and obligations associated with Instruments such as Vouchers. E.g. This is to ensure that anyone can look-up who issued a Voucher and how it can be redeemed as payment. This may include contact information and endorsments for a business or community group issuing a Voucher. Non-Confidential Phone Number Mandatory Phone Number for Account (USSD) Access Confidential Pin / Password Mandatory Needed for account access Confidential Public Key Mandatory Anonymous ledger account code Non-Confidential Private Key Mandatory Ledger account key needed for Account (USSD) Access Confidential Transaction Histories Mandatory Ledger Information (non-PII) referencing only Public Key for all registered Instruments utilized by Members Non-Confidential Agreements /Contracts Mandatory Signed agreements for groups issuing their own Instruments.

Preamble: \u00b6 In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License aims to encourage transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in the distribution and exchange of all offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets. By adhering to this license, entities affirm their commitment to public awareness and uphold the ideals of a transparent heritage. Many licenses are crafted to restrict your ability to share and adapt what is offered. In contrast, the PATH License aims to ensure your freedom to share, adapt, and understand all versions of an offering, ensuring it remains accessible and transparent for all its recipients. This can apply to many types of offerings including software but also with respect to food. e.g. The Recipent of tomatoes (an offering) using this license would have the right to full disclosure from the Provider on the origin, farming practices and variety of tomatoes - as as well have the right to use it in a recipe for pizza and offer pizza under the same license - again giving Full Disclosure to any following Recipients. When we mention \"free\" in the context of this license, we refer to freedom of use and understanding, not cost. The PATH License ensures that you can distribute offerings (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive Full Disclosure about the offering, and that you can adapt or use parts of it in new offerings, knowing you have the rights to do so. Providers using the PATH License safeguard your rights by: (1) asserting rights over the offering, and (2) granting you this License, which provides legal permission to reproduce, copy, distribute, and/or modify the offering. A notable advantage of this approach is that enhancements made in alternate versions of an offering, if they gain traction, become available for other providers to integrate. Many providers are motivated by the resulting collaboration. However, for offerings like software used on network servers, this collaborative spirit might not always manifest. The PATH License ensures that in such scenarios, any modifications made are transparently available to the community. It mandates that operators of such offerings provide Comprehensive Insight into any modified version being used. The PATH License is inspired by previous licenses that aimed to achieve similar transparency and community-focused goals such as AGPL3.0. The specific terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification are detailed in the following sections. Terms and Conditions \u00b6 Definitions : \"Offering\" encompasses any goods, services, software, intangible assets, or other entities that are sold, given, exchanged, or to which access is granted. The \"Offering\" itself is akin to the final product or service that recipients interact with, similar to an food product or the binary or executable form of a software program. \"Provider\" refers to any distributor, reseller, or entity that offers access to an offering, or any derivative or modified version of it. \"Recipient\" denotes any individual, group, or entity that receives, acquires, or is granted access to the offering, whether through purchase, exchange, gift, or any other means. \"Convey\" an offering means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a Recipient with no offering being accepted, is not conveying. \"Comprehensive Insight\" for an offering refers to the detailed information, documentation, and resources that provide a holistic understanding of the offering, enabling modifications or adaptations. This includes Primary and System Componets, Standard Interfaces and Corresponding Insights. \"Primary Component\" in this context refers to a fundamental element or feature of the specific environment or platform in which the offering operates or is utilized. \"System Components\" of an offering encompass any elements, other than the offering as a whole, that (a) are typically included when packaging a Primary Component but are not part of that Primary Component, and (b) solely facilitate the use of the offering with that Primary Component or implement a Standard Interface for which Comprehensive Insight is publicly accessible. \"Standard Interface\" denotes an interface or method of interaction that is either an established standard defined by a recognized body or, in the context of specific offerings, one that is widely accepted and utilized within that domain. \"Corresponding Insight\" for an offering encompasses all the comprehensive insight required to understand, adapt, and utilize the offering and to make modifications to it. This includes any tools, methods, or scripts integral to these activities. However, it excludes the offering's System Components or any general-purpose tools or universally accessible free methods used unaltered in these activities but not intrinsic to the offering. For instance, Corresponding Insight would include definitions, specifications, or any other essential details linked with the offering, and the comprehensive insight for interconnected components that the offering is explicitly designed to work with. The Corresponding Insight doesn't need to cover elements that recipients can easily derive or reproduce from other parts of the Corresponding Insight. For an offering in its Comprehensive Insight form, the Corresponding Insight is the offering itself. The Tomato Example Imagine a unique variety of tomato being offered in a market. This tomato, let's call it the \"SunBlush Tomato,\" is not just any ordinary tomato; it has been cultivated using specific techniques, resulting in a distinct flavor profile and nutritional benefits. The Offering: The \"SunBlush Tomato\" itself, which consumers can buy, taste, and use in their dishes, represents the \"Offering.\" It's the tangible product that recipients interact with. Corresponding Insight: To truly understand and replicate the SunBlush Tomato, one would need its: The specific seed variety or genetic makeup of the SunBlush Tomato. The soil composition and farming techniques that were used to cultivate it. The unique harvesting and storage methods that ensure its distinct flavor and freshness. Recipes or culinary techniques that best showcase its unique properties. Standard Interface: In the context of our tomato, a \"Standard Interface\" might refer to common methods of tomato cultivation or standard culinary techniques used in preparing tomatoes. System Components: These could be the general farming tools used in the cultivation of many crops, not just the SunBlush Tomato. For instance, standard watering systems, generic fertilizers, or common storage bins that aren't unique to the SunBlush Tomato's cultivation process. Primary Component: In this example, the \"Primary Component\" could be the specific greenhouse environment or the particular soil bed where the SunBlush Tomato is grown, which plays a crucial role in its unique characteristics. When someone buys the SunBlush Tomato, they get the \"Offering.\" But if they wish to understand its uniqueness, cultivate it themselves, or explore its full potential in culinary applications, they would need the \"Comprehensive Insight.\" Under the PATH License, if the SunBlush Tomato is offered with this license, the provider would be obligated to share this Comprehensive Insight, ensuring transparency and allowing recipients to fully understand and potentially replicate or adapt the offering. Basic Permissions : All rights granted under this License persist for the term of any applicable rights on the Offering and are irrevocable as long as the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to utilize the unmodified Offering. The outcome or product resulting from the use of a covered offering is governed by this License only if the outcome, considering its content, qualifies as a covered offering. This License recognizes your rights of fair use or other equivalents, as provided by applicable laws. You may create, utilize, and propagate covered offerings that you do not convey, without conditions, as long as your license remains valid. You may convey covered offerings to others solely for them to make modifications exclusively for you or to provide you with facilities for utilizing those offerings, ensuring that you adhere to the terms of this License when conveying any material for whic'h you don't hold the rights. Those who modify or utilize the covered offerings for you must act exclusively on your behalf, under your guidance, and on terms that prevent them from creating any unauthorized copies of your protected material outside their association with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is allowed only under the conditions stated in this License. Sublicensing is not permitted; the provisions of this License make it unnecessary. Full Disclosure : When distributing or granting access to an offering, providers shall present recipients with exhaustive information vital for a holistic comprehension of said offering. If the nature of the offering allows, mechanisms must be instituted to facilitate access and potential modifications. This obligation is unceasing. Transparency of Alterations : Any divergences or subsequent changes from the original state of the offering must be candidly revealed by Providers. Reciprocal Transparency Responsibility : Recipients, in accepting, utilizing or leveraging the offering, are duty-bound to maintain the essence of these guidelines. This involves ensuring visibility for any alterations, derivatives, or re-distributions they might engage in. This continuous obligation, akin to a \"share alike\" ethos, mandates proper acknowledgment of sources. Engagements with External Offerings : In instances where the offering is integrated with another outside the purview of this license, provisions of this license persist for the original offering, retaining its accessibility and modifiability. Supportive Documentation : Providers must supply any auxiliary resources or explanations that are crucial for the user's effective engagement with the offering. This includes understanding, using, or potentially altering the offering. Parallel Freedom Provision : Should there arise a scenario where the offering's redistribution curtails customary access or adaptability, an obligation rests upon Providers to concurrently offer an unfettered version. Scenario: A local farmer, Mr. Green, has developed a unique variety of tomato that is more resilient to pests and has a longer shelf life. He decides to distribute these tomatoes under the PATH License. As part of his distribution, he also provides detailed information on the cultivation process, the seeds used, and the modifications he made to achieve this variety. After some time, a large agribusiness company, BigFarm Corp., takes interest in Mr. Green's tomatoes. They decide to buy a large quantity, package them in a special way, and sell them as \"Premium Long-Lasting Tomatoes.\" However, in their packaging process, they use a proprietary method that seals the tomatoes in such a way that prevents recipients from extracting seeds for replanting. This method curtails the customary access to the seeds and the adaptability of the tomatoes (since recipients can't grow their own from these tomatoes). Application of Parallel Freedom Provision: Under the PATH License's \"Parallel Freedom Provision,\" BigFarm Corp. has an obligation. While they can sell the specially packaged \"Premium Long-Lasting Tomatoes,\" they must also offer a version of Mr. Green's tomatoes without the restrictive packaging. This ensures that customers who wish to access the seeds and understand the tomato's cultivation can do so. In essence, alongside their \"Premium\" version, they'd need to provide an \"unfettered\" version that adheres to the principles of the PATH License. Infringements and Repercussions : Undertakings that sidestep, subvert, or are in contradiction to this license's tenets render the action non-binding. Such infractions could lead to the temporary or permanent rescinding of the rights bestowed by this license upon the offender. Rights Assurance : This license is not in contravention of and does not diminish any entitlements that recipients might hold under applicable copyright laws, other relevant regulations, or patent or trademark obligations. Conveyance of Duties and Privileges : It falls upon Providers to unambiguously relay the responsibilities and advantages intrinsic to this license when distributing or granting access, thus empowering recipients with a lucid grasp of their entitlements and commitments. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability : The offering is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. In no event shall the Provider be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the offering or the use or other dealings in the offering. Versioning and Updates : This license may be updated or revised in the future. Each version will be distinguished by a unique version number. When an offering is distributed or accessed under a specific version of this license, it will remain under that version's terms unless explicitly updated to a newer version by the Provider. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms \u00b6 If you develop a new offering, whether it's a program, service, tangible good, or intangible asset, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License. This ensures transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in its distribution and exchange. To do so, attach the following notices to the offering. If it's a software program, it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the offering's name and a brief idea of what it does. Copyright (C) (year) (name of author) This offering is made available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1. This offering is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the PATH License for more details. You should have received a copy of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1 along with this offering. If not, see https://docs.grassecon.org/commons/path Also add information on how to contact you. If your offering of software or service can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its details and source, if applicable. For example, if your offering is a web application, its interface could display a \"Details\" or \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive or description of the offering. There are many ways you could offer details, and different solutions will be better for different offerings; refer to the specific requirements of the PATH License.","title":"PATH License"},{"location":"commons/path/#public-awareness-transparent-heritage-path-license","text":"Version 0.1a August 22st 2023 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Grassroots Economics Foundation, Inc. https://grassecon.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"Public Awareness &amp; Transparent Heritage (PATH) License"},{"location":"commons/path/#preamble","text":"In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License aims to encourage transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in the distribution and exchange of all offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets.

This is achieved through mutually accepted and defined Instruments sharing surplus value, cost and risk equitably between real people and associations subscriber Members as follows: Producers and Users - creators of economic value and Instrument from shared use of Commons. Steward - active providers of core Commons development and management services Guardians - communication obligations and passive veto rights over Commons use. Organising Principles \u00b6 Care for People \u2013 collaboration and vision driven care for oneself and others\u2019 well-being and happiness Care for the Environment - support environmental protection and regeneration, minimize use of finite resources for economic activity, ecosystem management approach to farming and business development.

Reciprocity \u2013 mutual sharing of risk, cost and surplus Non-Dominance - no person or association to have dominant rights over another person or association\u2019s resources eg. data, finances, intellect, materials and freedom. Resilience - capacity to prepare for, address and adapt to economic, political, climate and other events in order to ensure sustainable community based systems/commons. Note that principals should be specific with how these Values are incorporated into objective and measurable Principles and Good Practices. Institutions and Instruments \u00b6 \u00b6 Ledger {#ledger} Ledgers are shared digital accounting databases which enumerate and qualify Instruments subject to mutual agreements or organizational rules. Instruments - bilateral mutual agreements or contracts between Members. Registration - publication of Instruments in machine-readable form executable on the Ledger. Management - Core Service Providers manage Ledgers subject to Clearing Agreements Issuer: Members individually or in association mutually agree in writing to meet obligations of registered Instruments. \u00b6 Community Asset Voucher (CAV) {#community-asset-voucher-cav} A Community Asset Voucher (CAV) is an instrument used within an Economic Commons to facilitate economic transactions and foster community development. CAV is designed to promote local trade, social cohesion, & sustainable practices. It can be considered both grassroots and circular in nature. As a grassroots instrument, CAV is often initiated and managed by local communities, enabling them to address their specific economic needs and priorities. It also embodies circular principles by incorporating mechanisms such as trade balance, expiration & re-issuance (demurrage), as well as drawing inspiration from indigenous practices of rotational mutual aid. CAVs encourage economic interactions that prioritize community well-being and the equitable distribution of resources while promoting sustainable and regenerative practices CAV \u2013 a promise denominated in a Unit of Account issued to an acceptor (i.e as a gift, in exchange for money or in-kind) and representing an assignable credit obligation of the Issuer to the acceptor or assignee. CAVs have the following properties.: Redemption: Vouchers presented in payment to the Issuer for goods and services supplied must be accepted in payment and are therefore redeemable. Digital Representation: digital Vouchers are defined and registered securely and immutably by Members on a public Ledger. Transparency: Instrument specifications are open to the general public while registered transactions are open to Members subject to the Clearing Agreement. Divisibility: Vouchers may be divided by the Issuer to the degree of precision specified when published on the Ledger. So the holder of a single Voucher may assign a fraction to another Member as digitally specified by the Issuer. Name and Symbol and Contract Address: Each Voucher must have a name and symbol specified by the Issuer, and a unique Contract Address (public key). Contact Information: The Voucher must include contact information for the Holder to know how to redeem the Voucher as payment for the Issuer's products. The Issuer must keep this information accurate and up-to date. Unit of Account: Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account. Example: 1000 Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the Issuing Member\u2019s products. Expiration: Vouchers may have a specified expiration date or an expiration rate. Expiration Rate: For example, a Voucher with an expiration rate of 2% per month would result in a holder having 98 Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Expiration Date: For example a Voucher with an expiration date of one month would result in a holder having 0 usable Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Sink Account and Issuance Period: Expired Vouchers will accrue in a specified Ledger account determined by the Issuer after a specified Issuance period. This means that the balance of Vouchers in the Sink Account will increase by the sum of expired Vouchers, after the Issuance Period. Supply: The supply of Vouchers may be increased or destroyed by vote of the Issuers. The supply of Vouchers shall always be based on the Issuer's capacity to redeem them as payment for their products within the specified expiration. Fungibility: Each Voucher is fungible with the vouchers issued under that same contract, meaning that it is interchangeable and mixable with them. An account holding multiple identical Vouchers would display the sum of their quantity as their Voucher Balance minus any expired Vouchers. Bearer Instrument: The Voucher is a \u201cdigital bearer instrument\u201d, meaning that anyone holding the access (private) key to the holder's Ledger account is considered the owner of the Voucher or Vouchers in that account. Note that Members may share keys or create accounts that require specific signing rules (like any 2 of 3 to sign). Utility: The Voucher is not marketed or sold by Members as an investment product. It confers no additional rights or benefits beyond the redemption for the Issuer's products. Liability: The Voucher is a credit obligation with joint and several liability of the Issuer. This means that the Issuers are collectively and individually responsible for fulfilling the obligation of the Voucher. Finality: Once published and registered on the Ledger certain Immutable Information cannot change while Mutable Information can be changed by Voucher Contract Manager. Immutable Information includes: Name, Symbol Expiration dates and rates Re-issuance period Precision Contract Address* (public Key) Unit of Account* Description* Issuer Name* Namespace*= An domain for which to register the Voucher. Proofs* (media files, hashes or attachments) Version number* Image* (optional logo) Address of Mutable Information (derived)* Valid from* (date that the contract was published) Valid until* (date that the information is considered outdated) Mutable Information* includes: Voucher Contract Manager (public key) Voucher supply (via minting or burning) Sink address Contact information* Name, phone number, email, location, country Signers (who attest to the certificate information being connected to the Voucher) (*) Note that all the above information is data stored and registered on a Certificate which is published on the Ledger Voucher Contract Management: The Voucher Contract (Smart contract) registered and published on the Ledger has a Manager that can edit the Mutable Information in the Voucher Contract. The default Manager is the Member that published the contract and who may transfer Management to any Account on the Ledger and also remove themselves as an Manager. Management can be transferred to a Smart Contract that enables different forms of voting etc. \u00b6 CAV Pool {#cav-pool} CAV Pool \u2013 a treasury object that can hold digital assets and enables exchange between them. The following are properties of Pools: Qualification: Pools are collections of digital objects with various exchangeability to each other. I.e. CAVs can be made redeemable for the other CAVs within the pool. By adding CAVs to the pool one can automatically receive an equivalent amount of other CAVs available to the Pool contract. Finality: Mutable Information published and registered on the Ledger may be amended by a Certificate Publisher but Immutable Information may not. Specification: (TBD) Acceptance: Which Vouchers are allowed in the pool Caps: The maximum quantity of each voucher allowed in the pool Price Index: Relative prices for the vouchers in the pool Pool Fees: A fee can be placed on exchanges and the Manager can assign where these fees go. Pool Management: The Manager of the Pool has permission to edit Mutable Information in the Pool. The default Manager is the Publishing Member who may assign Management to another Member and also resign as a Manager. A Pool Manager can also be a group operating a multi-signature wallet. \u00b6 Certificate {#certificate} Certificate (Bilateral/Unilateral Instrument) \u2013 a data object qualified as acceptable by another Member. A Certificate is similar to a University Diploma in which the University makes an attestation (qualification) that a Student has passed their coursework. The following are properties of Certificates: Qualification: Certificates qualify data such as Voucher usage or capacity to perform services. Vouchers as well as Members may be Certified by other Members, for various roles, services, accomplishments and so on. Certification qualifies Members or Instruments. Note in the Voucher Instrument example, Immutable and Mutable data are stored or referenced on a Certificate (denoted by (*)) No Obligation: on Issuers to accept their Certificates in exchange for goods & services. Finality: Mutable Information published and registered on the Ledger may be amended by a Certificate Publisher but Immutable Information may not. Certificate Management: the Manager of Certificate (Instrument) Publication and registration on the Ledger has permission to edit Mutable Information in the Certificate. The default Manager is the Publishing Member who may assign Management to another Member and also resign as a Manager. Revocation or Expiration: a Certificate can expire and/or be revoked but the chain of attestation will be preserved on the Ledger. Acceptance or Denial: the Member holding the Private Key to the public address of the Certificate can accept, deny and comment on the validity of the Certificate Finality: Immutable Properties of the Certificate cannot be amended once published and registered on the Ledger, Governance \u00b6 \u00b6 Membership {#membership} A Member of an Economic Commons is an individual person, organization or an association of Members with a common purpose, who ratify and Implement an Economic Commons it or use implemented Economic Commons Instruments as per their local needs There are three Member Classes defined below, with the following rights and obligations: General Members Right to utilize all Economic Commons-defined Instruments Right to hold or delegate custodianship of Ledger Accounts and Instruments Right to hold multiple Accounts and Instruments in the Ledger Right to vote on the usage of their issued Instruments in a Community Fund Right to view and inspect all Accounts and Instrument kept on the Ledger Obligation to report Members that don't comply to this Agreement or local laws Obligation to certify Core Service Providers Obligation to register any Instrument or Instrument usage on the Ledger and keep any relevant information up to date.

Sometimes people receive money from humanitarian organizations in the form of CVAs (cash and voucher assistance), or they send their family members to work in the cities so that they can send money back home. The community live at subsistence, unable to build or develop anything and with low cohesion in working together. The community members have excess capacity, they have skills and time and resources. A community has a chronic lack of money, but human capacity and basic resources that are underutilized One of the big needs that they have is to grow their own food and increase their local capacity, which takes a lot of labour. Luckily the supply (farm inputs) and the demand (for food) are local. The basic resources are there, but there is an inability to pool them. With effective coordination and utilisation of the local resources and excess capacity, there is potential for a resilient and abundant local market of goods and services. One of the big hurdles the community faces in starting a farm is the severe erosion of the land from torrential rains and historically bad farming practices. They need to be able to coordinate their capacity to ready the land, collect water and control erosion. After which there are plenty more tasks to complete, such as seed harvesting, mulching, building fences - all requiring human power and labour. Some community members are overworked, they are stretched for time, and need others to take on some of their load, but are short of national currency in order to pay for that labour. Simply put, there is land that can be tilled, and people that can farm - there is potential for the production of local food that would be able to support that community from within rather than without. Within the community there is a group that saves money together, they have a structured chama/tontine/VSLA whereby they provide financial support to the internal members through a collective savings pool. They call themselves \u2018Binguni\u2019, and they want a better life for themselves, and their families. Creating a CAV \u00b6 Members of the Binguni group have heard of Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) that help empower marginalized communities to take charge of their own livelihoods and economic future. They connect with a core service provider (CSP) who are prepared to help them through the process. The CSP begins to engage with the community, local government, community elders and leaders to ascertain whether the community has sufficient latent capacity and resources, paired with a demand for the realization of the potential of both. The community group engages with a Core Service Provider to learn **A Core Service Provider(CSP) works with Binguni to map the resources and capacity of the community, to gauge latent/potential abundance amongst them and the area. Once mapped, the CSP brings awareness to the community of the available resources and capacity. The community group is now aware of their potential, but with the local deficit of national currency to create market liquidity. They lack the instrument with which to trade with each other in order to develop an economy around their available resources and capacity. An CSP trains the community group on the value of Community Asset Vouchers. The community group decides to issue their own Community Inclusion Currency - a tradable Voucher, redeemable for the collective goods and services within the group. The group gathers, and each member presents the quantity of goods or services they have to offer within a month (either as a month\u2019s value, or 12% of a year\u2019s value) and are willing to provide in exchange for the vouchers (CAVs) that they will create. They denominate their offerings in national currency, and there is a collective verification of that value by elders, chiefs, and others. Joining a Economic Commons \u00b6 The community group becomes part of an Economic Commons In order to issue their own CAV, the group needs to enter into three agreements, in this order: An Economic Commons Agreement: this is an agreement every member has to sign individually, and is effectively a terms and conditions of the full ecosystem. A Membership Agreement: this agreement exists between the members of the group (Binguni), and ensures that: They\u2019ve identified and quantified their commitments /offerings to each other, using national currency as the unit of account. They\u2019ve all been audited and verified on their commitments/offerings, by the chiefs/elders/chairpersons/local governance. They\u2019ve agreed on the total supply/quantity of vouchers to be issued, matched to their commitments, and have named their voucher. They\u2019ve agreed to accept the vouchers for their goods and services. They\u2019ve set limits to how many vouchers they can receive for their goods and services within a day/week/month/year, to ensure that they never receive more than they are able to spend (ensuring movement of vouchers). They set a group issuance limit on the vouchers , to ensure that the amount of vouchers created matches the redeemable goods and services. They\u2019ve agreed to, and elected a means of mediation/arbitration in case there is a fault. They\u2019ve agreed on a gradual expiration of the vouchers to ensure that the voucher is not hoarded, but traded (demurrage). Because groups don't want their vouchers to be lost forever in the hands of collectors/hoarders they ensure that they expire slowly over time at ~2% a month - and return to their group accounts. This means that anyone holding 100 Vouchers will loose 2 of them from their account each month. These amounts in the community funds of the groups can be used for projects and supporting the needy. They\u2019ve agreed on any savings/voucher-pooling mechanisms within the group, and what that savings will be used for. A CU Intermember Agreement: this is an agreement with a Core Service Provider around training, arbitration of disputes, instrument creation, data handling and technical platform access & maintenance (access to the core ledger, blockchain, wallet, phone support etc). Now that they have joined an Economic Commons, and established themselves as a group. Binguni is now considered an association of CU members and anyone holding their Binguni Vouchers is also considered a member through the terms of service. In this case the Binguni member decide to all commit to the same amount goods and services they will redeem for vouchers, so that the voucher amount created is the same for each member. Auditing should verify that these vouchers are over-collateralized such that there is more production than vouchers, rather than too many vouchers without the resources to match. James, a local farmer, is able to provide 10 kg of seeds in a month to the value of 2500 shillings, calculated as 12% of his yearly offering and receives 2500 Binguni vouchers. Pamela, a local cook, is able to provide daily cakes and potatoes to the value of 2500 shillings over a month and receives 2500 Vouchers. All 20 Internal Members offer 2500 shillings worth of their monthly goods and services, and agree to a combined commitment of 50,000 shillings worth of value. They present this in their agreement with Grassroots Economics, and 50000 vouchers are issued/minted, connected to the blockchain. They name their voucher \u201cBIGI\u201d. Each Member of Binguni is issued 2500 BIGIs, and each elect to put 200 of that back into the communal pot. Each member now has 2300 BIGIs, and the communal pot has 4000. This pot could be used as a group savings or loan account, but the group agrees to use the savings for the project of the future farm - a group business that they will all benefit from in the long run. They could have elected to issue vouchers directly to the project, based on the estimated future value of the farm - in which case 2500 would have gone to the project as if it were a member, but the group decided to save communally, rather than risk minting vouchers with an uncertain future production value. Doing it this way has meant that all of the vouchers are more reliably redeemable for goods and services, as they were backed by auditable production of the members prior to issuance. Using their CAV \u00b6 Each member now has 2300 BIGIs, and they can begin to trade. James, the seed farmer, gives Pamela 20 BIGI for this breakfast cakes. Pamela, now has 2320 BIGIs, she doesn\u2019t need seeds from James, but she uses 200 BIGIs to pay her friend Joyce, another Member, to cook with her for the day so that she has prepared enough fried potatoes for the community meeting that evening. Joyce spent 300 BIGI on water that morning, from John who walks to the spring each day to collect water. By midday their accounts look like: Pamela: 2120 BIGIs Joyce: 2200 John: 2600 At the community meeting, members of Binguni are there, as well as others in the community. Pamela is selling her potatoes at 5 BIGI each, and sells a total of 50 potatoes to Binguni members who have paid with BIGIs. She also sold another 50 in Kenyan shillings to community members who don't wish to take part. She leaves the community meeting with 250 BIGI, and 250 shillings. Pamela now has 2370 BIGIs in her digital wallet, and can add the 250 shillings she earning to her savings and continue to trade with the BIGIs. The BINGUNI group gathers to decide on what they need to do to start farming. Within the group they have labour, skills, seeds and access to water, but they lack a few resources. The main thing they lack is a womanpower. A group of local farmers in Mbele, have spare time to do land preparation - but the Binguni group are short of shillings to be able to pay them. BINGUNI members approach the Mbele group, and ask whether he would be willing to receive partial payment in BIGIs. Mbele women agree to accept BIGIs as partial payment, and can now redeem the vouchers for resources they needs, that members within BINGUNI have, namely seeds and water. They also come to the Binguni community meeting, where they taste Pamela\u2019s fried potatoes and loved them, so they plans on using some of their BIGIs to buy from her at the next meeting as well. More CAVs form \u00b6 Seeing the success of the Binguni community, the Mbele group decides to issue their own Vouchers. In the same environment region, with slightly different skills and resources, they have different goods and services to offer in exchange for their vouchers. The Mbele group has members that are skilled in water management, which would be of value to the broader community if that capacity were shared. The Mbele voucher is called an MBELE. A CSP also trains the Binguni and Mbele groups on the methods of syntropic agroforestry, to upskill them and develop more sustainable farming practices within the community. The training is intended to bring a more sustainable income generating activity to the community, using the CAVs as a financial instrument bridge between excess capacity and a thriving local economy. Both groups have a communal savings pot that they have dedicated toward a group business. The groups are trained, and start to use their communal vouchers to pay for labour within their group. Because Mbele and Binguni have different, but complementary goods and services, the groups decide to accept each others\u2019 vouchers. A Binguni member is paid in MBELEs for his time spent tilling the land on the communal property of the Mbele group. A Mbele member is paid in BIGIs for her time teaching the Binguni group how to manage erosion on their land. Many more trades happen between the communities in service of developing their farms and farming practices. John, the local farmer with the plough, is now valuable to both groups and decides to accept partial payments in BIGIs and MBELEs. He is now able to redeem those vouchers for goods and services from the two groups (seeds, water management labour, rich soil), and hopes to be able to redeem them in the future for the fresh produce that the new farms will provide. The vouchers have provided a link between the latent capacity and a circular local trade of goods and services, for the benefit of the community. Through their circulation these vouchers form a Community Inclusion Currency (CAV). The group members have started to save their Kenyan shillings and are able to use that money for investments into education, infrastructure, housing and resources that are available to them. Humanitarian Support \u00b6 A humanitarian organization, wants to support the broader community in this area of Kenya. They have two options to do so: They can invest in developing more income generating activities within the community. For example, they could buy a maize mill, or provide business training to the group members in order to improve their ability to generate income with their latent capacity. This can increase the amount of CAVs that the community can redeem and hence issue. They can buy the BIGIs and MBELEs from the groups, either from the communal pots or from the members themselves, and redistribute those vouchers out to the broader community. They are effectively pre-buying the goods and services of the members within the group, and allowing for the broader community to have access to goods and services that they didn\u2019t have money for before. Rather than providing cash, which would quickly leave the community, the vouchers ensure a local circulation of goods and services, and a boost to local trade. This is similar to a Cash and Voucher Assistance program but with the vouchers coming from the local community. Providing aid in this way, to the communities, has allowed for higher volumes and more sustainable circulation of goods and services through the community, a huge step from basic cash assistance. Through the implementation of capacity building like syntropic agroforestry, and more importantly, the linkage of Community Asset Vouchers, the communities have bypassed stagnate markets and moved toward a conscious decision and ability to coordinate.","title":"Case Study"},{"location":"edu/case_study/#cav-case-study-binguni-mbele-in-kenya","text":"","title":"CAV Case Study - Binguni &amp; Mbele in Kenya"},{"location":"edu/case_study/#trapped-abundance","text":"There is a community of 400 households in a drought-ridden area in Kenya that has a chronic lack of money, and few commercially valuable exports to the big cities. Sometimes people receive money from humanitarian organizations in the form of CVAs (cash and voucher assistance), or they send their family members to work in the cities so that they can send money back home. The community live at subsistence, unable to build or develop anything and with low cohesion in working together. The community members have excess capacity, they have skills and time and resources. A community has a chronic lack of money, but human capacity and basic resources that are underutilized One of the big needs that they have is to grow their own food and increase their local capacity, which takes a lot of labour. Luckily the supply (farm inputs) and the demand (for food) are local. The basic resources are there, but there is an inability to pool them. With effective coordination and utilisation of the local resources and excess capacity, there is potential for a resilient and abundant local market of goods and services. One of the big hurdles the community faces in starting a farm is the severe erosion of the land from torrential rains and historically bad farming practices. They need to be able to coordinate their capacity to ready the land, collect water and control erosion. After which there are plenty more tasks to complete, such as seed harvesting, mulching, building fences - all requiring human power and labour. Some community members are overworked, they are stretched for time, and need others to take on some of their load, but are short of national currency in order to pay for that labour. Simply put, there is land that can be tilled, and people that can farm - there is potential for the production of local food that would be able to support that community from within rather than without. Within the community there is a group that saves money together, they have a structured chama/tontine/VSLA whereby they provide financial support to the internal members through a collective savings pool.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Basics Running a Business Group usage and Regulation Quiz Basics \u00b6 What are Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs)? CAVs are tradable Vouchers, redeemable as payment for goods and/or services of issuers or other participating individuals, organizations, schools, shops, groups, farms, and clinics. Anyone can create their own CAV which can act as a local means of trade and exchange that does not replace but rather supplements (tops-up) lacking national currency. Through increasing trade by matching unmet local needs with under-utilized local resources CAVs enable sustainable economic, environmental and social development. Here you can see our definition of a Voucher . Note that we will often call all CAVs on Sarafu Network a Voucher or Sarafu . How do you create a CAV / Voucher / Sarafu? People, groups (chamas) and organizations can issue or create a CAV by creating a backing guarantee or Commitment Agreement - see Voucher creation under Operations . What is my CAV\u2019s exchange rate? When creating a CAV you specify the unit of account. Generally issuers create CAVs denominated in a small unit of their services or goods, like on minute of specific work or 1 egg. There is no official exchange for CAVs and national currency - the only guarantee is redemption for goods and services of the issuers - as payment in-lieu of, or in addition to national currency. Please check if your CAV is within any Commitment Pool on https://sarafu.network How do you get more CAV? Buying: By allowing users to buy your goods or services using CAV, this is considered barter trade as you should be able to spend the CAV you receive back at other users in the community. This doesn\u2019t change the CAVs exchange value. n.b. You could also call this selling your Vouchers in-kind. Note that while vouchers can be exchanged for other vouchers or goods and services they can also be exchanged for (purchased with) national currency - but there is no guarantee of redemption for national currency. Creating/Minting: People, groups (chamas) and organizations can issue or create a CAV by creating a backing guarantee as part of their Membership Agreement - see Operations . Redistribution: A group creating a CAV may give out CAV to members and collect it back as a tax and redistribute for community support. What is the difference between Sarafu (SRF) and other Vouchers/CAVs on Sarafu Network Become a user: When someone first creates a CAV wallet on Sarafu Network they get some (currently 5 but it may change depending on the supply avalible) Sarafu (SRF) tokens. These Vouchers are used to train people how to use the system and prepare for making their own CAV. Refer to new users: Sarafu (SRF) is often given as a reward to the first person who trades with a new user. SRF is the Voucher of Grassroots Economics Foundation and redeemable for our services such as Voucher creation and training. What are the benefits of using CAVs? Meet basic needs: enable people and their community to meet daily needs during the hard times of the month or year or during a crisis. Increase trade: increase your daily sales and customers; and to save more National Currency for needs outside the community. Reduce Informal debt: instead of trading increase your daily sales and customers; and to save more National Currency for needs outside the community. Strengthen local markets: create a strong community network and market (allowing people to meet, share ideas, trade goods and services and to launch group programs and initiatives). Community participation: enable greater participation in community events What are the benefits of creating CAVs? Leverage: By committing resources backing CAV you create a credit (with no interest) against your future production and multiply your purchasing power. Share holders: Because CAVs derive their value from social backing (acceptance of goods and services) - by holding CAVs members hold a share of a fiscal commons. This gives holders a stake in the local economy. Traceability: Since people and even donors can see anonymous trading data they can choose to support a CAV that is supporting a community in need. CAV's can in turn be purchased by humanitarian orgs and redistributed to both help empower and support vulnerable communities. Why is it important to keep CAVs circulating? The more CAVs are exchanged among members, the more it they develop the local economy. If they stops circulating, they stops helping people trade. As much as anyone spends a CAV they should also be accepting CAV for any goods or services to support the community. The impact a CAV has on the local community and economy is higher the more CAVs are used (multiplier effect). Trade Balance (TB) TB can be defined as the amount of CAV spent by the amount of CAV received for goods and services minus the amount they have spent. The goal for good circulation is to maintain a 0 trade balance. Voucher Issuing Members wishing to leave the network should also come back to a zero trade balance before leaving. A TB less than zero represents a situation where they have spent more than they have accepted back and are therefore in debt to the community and should accept more CAV. While a TB greater than zero would represent having received more CAV than they have spent and the user should spend more CAV in the community. Running a Business \u00b6 How do I top-up my CAV once I have used it? Try to buy using your CAV each day and try to sell your goods with CAV each day. Balance your purchases and sales. Get CAVs for volunteer work from supporting organizations. Create your own CAV. How do I cash-out my CAV to get National Currency? This is not possible. Who is a CAV Issuer? Any group can issue a CAV by completing a Membership Agreement. Generally these are community groups with the permission of Village Elders/Admins. Who are CAV holders? Anyone agreeing to the Sarafu Network Terms and Conditions can have a CAV account via mobile phone and is considered a Member of the Grassroots Economic Commons. The CAVs stored in your account are yours alone and represent an investment you hold in an economy made up of other CAV holders. How much CAV should I keep? Your balance may go up and down but on average you should match your spending with your income of CAVs. If you decide to hold CAVs long term you are investing in the growth of the economy they represent (markets and businesses using the CAV). What should I do if I have too many CAVs? If you receive more CAV than you are able to spend, you can solve this problem by: Finding workers or businesses to buy services from using CAVs Enrolling businesses that you want to spend CAVs at! Giving CAV as change to your customers or as top ups or salary advances to your workers. Contact the CAV issuer or group and explain the situation and ask for help. What should I do if I have too little CAVs? By spending your CAVs you have received goods and/or services from other users. You must accept CAVs back for your goods and services. You need more customers with CAV. Have your customers register and advertise yourself to more members. If no one is buying your goods and services using CAV Contact the CAV issuers or chama Enroll your clients and get a referral bonus Buy goods and services from members in Kenyan Shillings and accept change in CAVs. What should I do if other members are not accepting CAVs 1:1 with national currency as indicated on the CAV? Make sure the member understands the program; they might not understand how to price their items using CAVs Give the person a chance to explain why they are not accepting it and try again later. If the member has too much CAV already, help them find a way to spend it. If all else fails, report the user to the CAV issuer or chama or local chief. How should I price my goods and services in CAVs? Price of goods or services should be that same price in CAVs as that used for National Currency. In general accept as much as you think you can use. It is your responsibility to make sure that you can use all the CAVs you receive. What happens if a CAV Issuer stops accepting back CAVs? There are repercussions as per the Membership Agreement and the issue can be taken to arbitration and the local administration. Restocking: If I buy stock and my supplier isn\u2019t a member, how can I buy my supplies and stock with CAVs? If your supplier isn\u2019t a member, explain to them the benefits of creating more business. Vouchers are a normal part of many businesses. If your supplier refuses to become a member, you will make sure to accept as much Kenya Shillings as you need in addition to CAV to buy your stock. Accepting CAV for your profit margin only is a way to avoid not being able to restock. Ultimately it is up to the CAV user to make appropriate business decisions. Group usage and Regulation \u00b6 How are CAVs regulated? On August 23 rd 2013, Bangla-Pesa which is a CAV was deemed by the Director of Public Prosecution in Kenya to not have broken any laws. Do CAVs expire? CAVs gradually expire in the form of a levy on balances. Which generally accrues to 2% a month and automatically goes to the creator or community group creating that CAV. How does a Savings Group (Chama) use CAVs? Chama members can register for an account and begin to save and loan CAVs just like they do with National Currencies. One chama member account is designated as the Chama account where members store their savings. The chamas unique CAV tokens will be distributed to the members of the chama and used for paying people inside or outside the chama for goods or services. The Chama can facilitate market days and weekly deposits as well as loan repayment in CAVs. Why would someone hold CAVs long term? Because of the holding fee we do not recommend holding CAV long term. Users are expected to use the CAV mainly as a means of exchange in the local business community and to keep the KSH to build up savings or buy \u201cimported\u201d products. Your CAV vs other CAVs (Trading between communities) If someone sends you another CAV from another community, you will have multiple CAVs in your wallet and can choose between them. Each CAV represents the goods and services of a particular community. What is the technology behind CAVs? CAVs are digital and residing on a public blockchain. CAVs accounts can be accessed through USSD on feature phones - and soon an app and web interface. The Sarafu Network was built using Python and Typescript and Solidity Is the technology open source? Yes all docs and code can be found here How do you prevent a run on the reserves of a CAV? There is no automated reserve on-chain. CAV should be created against goods and services. The real world reserves of goods and services offered by CAV Issuers should always be more than the amount of CAV created. Sarafu Network will not mint/create more CAV (Vouchers) for an issuer than they can redeem in a year and generally 1 month.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Basics Running a Business Group usage and Regulation Quiz","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"edu/faq/#basics","text":"What are Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs)? CAVs are tradable Vouchers, redeemable as payment for goods and/or services of issuers or other participating individuals, organizations, schools, shops, groups, farms, and clinics. Anyone can create their own CAV which can act as a local means of trade and exchange that does not replace but rather supplements (tops-up) lacking national currency. Through increasing trade by matching unmet local needs with under-utilized local resources CAVs enable sustainable economic, environmental and social development. Here you can see our definition of a Voucher . Note that we will often call all CAVs on Sarafu Network a Voucher or Sarafu . How do you create a CAV / Voucher / Sarafu? People, groups (chamas) and organizations can issue or create a CAV by creating a backing guarantee or Commitment Agreement - see Voucher creation under Operations . What is my CAV\u2019s exchange rate? When creating a CAV you specify the unit of account. Generally issuers create CAVs denominated in a small unit of their services or goods, like on minute of specific work or 1 egg. There is no official exchange for CAVs and national currency - the only guarantee is redemption for goods and services of the issuers - as payment in-lieu of, or in addition to national currency. Please check if your CAV is within any Commitment Pool on https://sarafu.network How do you get more CAV? Buying: By allowing users to buy your goods or services using CAV, this is considered barter trade as you should be able to spend the CAV you receive back at other users in the community. This doesn\u2019t change the CAVs exchange value. n.b. You could also call this selling your Vouchers in-kind. Note that while vouchers can be exchanged for other vouchers or goods and services they can also be exchanged for (purchased with) national currency - but there is no guarantee of redemption for national currency. Creating/Minting: People, groups (chamas) and organizations can issue or create a CAV by creating a backing guarantee as part of their Membership Agreement - see Operations . Redistribution: A group creating a CAV may give out CAV to members and collect it back as a tax and redistribute for community support. What is the difference between Sarafu (SRF) and other Vouchers/CAVs on Sarafu Network Become a user: When someone first creates a CAV wallet on Sarafu Network they get some (currently 5 but it may change depending on the supply avalible) Sarafu (SRF) tokens. These Vouchers are used to train people how to use the system and prepare for making their own CAV. Refer to new users: Sarafu (SRF) is often given as a reward to the first person who trades with a new user. SRF is the Voucher of Grassroots Economics Foundation and redeemable for our services such as Voucher creation and training. What are the benefits of using CAVs? Meet basic needs: enable people and their community to meet daily needs during the hard times of the month or year or during a crisis. Increase trade: increase your daily sales and customers; and to save more National Currency for needs outside the community. Reduce Informal debt: instead of trading increase your daily sales and customers; and to save more National Currency for needs outside the community. Strengthen local markets: create a strong community network and market (allowing people to meet, share ideas, trade goods and services and to launch group programs and initiatives). Community participation: enable greater participation in community events What are the benefits of creating CAVs? Leverage: By committing resources backing CAV you create a credit (with no interest) against your future production and multiply your purchasing power. Share holders: Because CAVs derive their value from social backing (acceptance of goods and services) - by holding CAVs members hold a share of a fiscal commons. This gives holders a stake in the local economy. Traceability: Since people and even donors can see anonymous trading data they can choose to support a CAV that is supporting a community in need. CAV's can in turn be purchased by humanitarian orgs and redistributed to both help empower and support vulnerable communities. Why is it important to keep CAVs circulating? The more CAVs are exchanged among members, the more it they develop the local economy. If they stops circulating, they stops helping people trade. As much as anyone spends a CAV they should also be accepting CAV for any goods or services to support the community. The impact a CAV has on the local community and economy is higher the more CAVs are used (multiplier effect). Trade Balance (TB) TB can be defined as the amount of CAV spent by the amount of CAV received for goods and services minus the amount they have spent. The goal for good circulation is to maintain a 0 trade balance. Voucher Issuing Members wishing to leave the network should also come back to a zero trade balance before leaving. A TB less than zero represents a situation where they have spent more than they have accepted back and are therefore in debt to the community and should accept more CAV. While a TB greater than zero would represent having received more CAV than they have spent and the user should spend more CAV in the community.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"edu/faq/#running-a-business","text":"How do I top-up my CAV once I have used it? Try to buy using your CAV each day and try to sell your goods with CAV each day. Balance your purchases and sales. Get CAVs for volunteer work from supporting organizations. Create your own CAV. How do I cash-out my CAV to get National Currency? This is not possible. Who is a CAV Issuer? Any group can issue a CAV by completing a Membership Agreement. Generally these are community groups with the permission of Village Elders/Admins. Who are CAV holders? Anyone agreeing to the Sarafu Network Terms and Conditions can have a CAV account via mobile phone and is considered a Member of the Grassroots Economic Commons. The CAVs stored in your account are yours alone and represent an investment you hold in an economy made up of other CAV holders. How much CAV should I keep? Your balance may go up and down but on average you should match your spending with your income of CAVs. If you decide to hold CAVs long term you are investing in the growth of the economy they represent (markets and businesses using the CAV). What should I do if I have too many CAVs? If you receive more CAV than you are able to spend, you can solve this problem by: Finding workers or businesses to buy services from using CAVs Enrolling businesses that you want to spend CAVs at! Giving CAV as change to your customers or as top ups or salary advances to your workers. Contact the CAV issuer or group and explain the situation and ask for help. What should I do if I have too little CAVs? By spending your CAVs you have received goods and/or services from other users. You must accept CAVs back for your goods and services. You need more customers with CAV. Have your customers register and advertise yourself to more members. If no one is buying your goods and services using CAV Contact the CAV issuers or chama Enroll your clients and get a referral bonus Buy goods and services from members in Kenyan Shillings and accept change in CAVs. What should I do if other members are not accepting CAVs 1:1 with national currency as indicated on the CAV? Make sure the member understands the program; they might not understand how to price their items using CAVs Give the person a chance to explain why they are not accepting it and try again later. If the member has too much CAV already, help them find a way to spend it. If all else fails, report the user to the CAV issuer or chama or local chief. How should I price my goods and services in CAVs? Price of goods or services should be that same price in CAVs as that used for National Currency. In general accept as much as you think you can use. It is your responsibility to make sure that you can use all the CAVs you receive. What happens if a CAV Issuer stops accepting back CAVs? There are repercussions as per the Membership Agreement and the issue can be taken to arbitration and the local administration. Restocking: If I buy stock and my supplier isn\u2019t a member, how can I buy my supplies and stock with CAVs? If your supplier isn\u2019t a member, explain to them the benefits of creating more business. Vouchers are a normal part of many businesses. If your supplier refuses to become a member, you will make sure to accept as much Kenya Shillings as you need in addition to CAV to buy your stock. Accepting CAV for your profit margin only is a way to avoid not being able to restock. Ultimately it is up to the CAV user to make appropriate business decisions.","title":"Running a Business"},{"location":"edu/faq/#group-usage-and-regulation","text":"How are CAVs regulated? On August 23 rd 2013, Bangla-Pesa which is a CAV was deemed by the Director of Public Prosecution in Kenya to not have broken any laws. Do CAVs expire? CAVs gradually expire in the form of a levy on balances. Which generally accrues to 2% a month and automatically goes to the creator or community group creating that CAV. How does a Savings Group (Chama) use CAVs? Chama members can register for an account and begin to save and loan CAVs just like they do with National Currencies. One chama member account is designated as the Chama account where members store their savings. The chamas unique CAV tokens will be distributed to the members of the chama and used for paying people inside or outside the chama for goods or services. The Chama can facilitate market days and weekly deposits as well as loan repayment in CAVs. Why would someone hold CAVs long term? Because of the holding fee we do not recommend holding CAV long term. Users are expected to use the CAV mainly as a means of exchange in the local business community and to keep the KSH to build up savings or buy \u201cimported\u201d products. Your CAV vs other CAVs (Trading between communities) If someone sends you another CAV from another community, you will have multiple CAVs in your wallet and can choose between them.

You will find out more information about what a CAV is and what kind of community support is needed. This guide gives enough background for you to know if you need to go back to one of those steps, but it does not cover them in full. It also does not cover next steps or the technical requirements for implementing a CAV. If your community has already begun using a CAV such as those created on Sarafu-Network in Kenya, you may want to do these exercises before creating a local CAV. Audience \u00b6 This guide is designed for project managers, community organizers and trainers who are familiar with the environment and communities they work with. Participants are members of a community who are interested in having a CAV in their community. The ideal group size for this training is (5-10ppl). We recommend that the first CAV training be given to participants who are respected in the community and who can encourage others to participate in the CAV as it is released. The course can be given to community leaders, businesses, group members, CAV designers, design challenge participants, students, humanitarian aid workers and volunteers. Participants who have an understanding of the local context and markets in which a CAV will be implemented will be best prepared to develop their own CAVs. Generally, the course is targeted at chamas or other savings and mutual aid groups. The trainer does not have to belong to the group that is being trained. The exercises in this guide are useful for communities where CAVs have been airdropped or granted, either before the community tries the CAV or at the end of the experiment with the initial CAV. Using an initial token like SRF in the Sarafu-Network will allow communities to better understand the specific challenges and advantages for their communities, and set up the proper checks and balances to make sure their own CAV is more successful if they do choose to launch a local CAV. Upon completion of the training, all of the participants should understand the training lessons and be prepared to make a decision about whether to move forward in additional education or in the implementation of a CAV in their community. After participating in this training, some of the participants will be capable of using and developing a CAV and training other community members. The trajectory of the training and the CAVs in general is to empower communities to take on the responsibility for their own financial well-being and economic growth. Purpose of the Training \u00b6 Groups using or creating Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) need to understand benefits, obligations and risks - as do supporting organizations and training groups. The process of creating a medium of exchange is about each member of a community knowing they have common needs - and most importantly, that they have something to offer their community, regardless of their personal circumstances. Experience is key in understanding how to use a CAV, therefore the course is structured around exercises and experiential learning. The facilitator should have a thorough understanding of the material, and be able to address questions that arise during the exercise. More in depth material can be found at CAV Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) . Before You Start \u00b6 Community Asset Vouchers is a specific type of formalized commitment. There are thousands of similar projects worldwide with different purposes. Community Asset Vouchers supplement government-issued money to help increase the economy of the community. Why CAVs? \u00b6 Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) are a means to launch community projects, jump-start or bolster local economies, boost financial inclusion and to foster independence and sustainability of underserved communities. CAVs are designed to fund community projects and support contributors. Using a CAV is a great way for funders to double or quadruple the amount of assistance they can provide and to encourage local economic resilience while integrating with other local, national and international economies. You can think of a CAV as an interest-free funding mechanism that can jump-start resilient economies. CAV\u2019s enable money that is used for projects to continue to circulate in the economy, rather than being used up as the project completes. The community itself can create mechanisms to renew the monetary supply, forgive debt and fund additional projects in the community. What a CAV Can (and Can\u2019t) Do \u00b6 A CAV can: Fund projects within a community Expand the credit available to people in a community Improve local economies and even jump-start economies that are cash-poor Create local interest-free credit using proven financial fundamental calculations Strengthen the agency of people to be proactive and take initiative Strengthen the bonds of people within a community Leverage a community\u2019s strengths and talents Allow exchange with other tokens Reduce dependence on interest-bearing loans Reduce inequality Reward non-economic behaviors (as defined today, such as planting a forest) only if the community provides ongoing backing for the project. A CAV cannot: Run independently: the community (or an agency) must have administrators who care for and manage the CAV system Operate without commitments from the issuing community to redeem the CAV for goods and services. Sarafu Network \u00b6 The Grassroots Economics Foundation works to empower local economies through CAVs. When users register on the network they are automatically given some SRF to use as an introduction to the CAV concept and technology. SRF is a CAV that is created by Grassroots Economics and used for training and CAV related services. Grassroots Economics is partnering with organizations such as the Red Cross to provide support for CAV programs. SRF is granted to communities throughout Kenya. These grants, sometimes called Airdrops, will serve as a trial for communities to experiment with the CAV before determining whether they would like to launch their own CAV. SRF used to teach people the basic CAV concepts. The SRF injection offers the following benefits to communities receiving the grants: Actual experience with a CAV before creating their own. Injection of credit (SRF) that can be used by local people to pay for their expenses. Encouragement of local economic activity. Infusion of funds that goes where the people want it to go, encouraging independence rather than dependence. Statistics on the usage of the SRF. When it becomes time to implement their own CAV, these communities will have actual data on how SRF was used and they can determine the correct local policies based on real data. However, the injection of SRF or any CAV also poses some risks to the communities, so it is important that there be some education about CAVs. Potential risks: If people misuse the CAV, some individuals may lose money, goods or services. People could become disillusioned with the use of alternative currencies rather than learning lessons for improvement. Communities may come to expect that charities will purchase CAVs with no strings attached, encouraging dependence on aid agencies. This manual provides educational resources that can be used by any community to mitigate these risks. If CAVs are used properly, they become long-term structures for the economic health of communities. Creating CAVs \u00b6 CAVs are vouchers which are backed by commitment of goods and services. This manual guides a community through determining how to use, create and allocate CAV to people and projects. CAVs must be backed 100% by local goods and services of the issuers like vouchers. This means that credit, in the form of CAVs, is infused into the community based on the commitments from the issuers. Gathering the Participants \u00b6 To have a CAV function in your community, you will need stakeholder businesses to redeem the CAV for goods and services. Therefore, it is important that a CAV is created by a group of initial participants that includes important community members such as leaders, business owners, pastors, farmers, and producers. The more influential the participants are, the faster the CAV will spread in the community. Being Willing to Play \u00b6 Participants in this training on CAVs will get an experience of how a CAV would work in their community. The exercises in this guide are designed prior to implementation so that enough community members can understand what they are getting into and make an intelligent decision as a community about next steps. They may or may not be ready to implement the CAV at the end of the training. Course Implementation \u00b6 Focus \u00b6 This CAV course keeps in mind the context of Kenya and seeks to make it as broad as possible for application in similar areas. The creators of CAVs in this course are primarily community groups, community based organizations, self help groups, SILCs, Chamas, Churches, or Village Savings and Loan Association. Group members should consist of people with local business and jobs that can trade amongst each other and can commit to reciprocity by backing a CAV as a legal voucher for their own goods and services. Goals \u00b6 Key goals include: The group trained should have the understanding, capacity and ability to: create a clear statement of commitment, with intent to issue and redeem a CAV as a voucher for stated goods and services. plan and navigate the steps toward CAV implementation Work with stakeholders to support the process The group will further explore the commitments, risks and obligations associated with issuing a CAV how to bring on more community and external support and acceptance of their CAV reciprocity, trade balance, what backs a CAV locally their relationship to the local economy and other community members and their role as a stakeholder in the creation of CAVs and an optimal community economy. Logistics \u00b6 Scripted in various languages for facilitators to follow along. This document guides a facilitator through the process of teaching several exercises: Additional material can be found at CAV Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) . Duration: Roughly 6 hours is enough time to go through the topics, exercises and discussions. A follow-up session once a training group has developed their CAV agreement is also necessary. Facilitation: Minimum 1 facilitator with experience training other groups and being part of a CAV. Having assistance or co-facilitators can help to hold different roles during exercises. Any mediators should also be trained and it is highly recommended to include local leaders and administration such as chief and sub-chiefs as they will be asked to validate community agreements. Materials: Facilitators should have: 1. A visible writing surface (white/black board, flipchart, manila or large paper and the ability to fix those papers on the wall). 2. (*optional) Ability to show a video. (eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__yvrxmpDh4 ) 3. A calculator or a smart phone with internet access. 4. Game Materials: 1. White paper (cut into business card sized pieces) 2. Beans to use as CAV (or another colored paper denominated with 10 CAV, reaching a total of 100 CAV). 3. Coins to use as Kenyan Shillings (a 10 bob coin for each participant will do - or a different color of paper slips) 4. Pencils or pens 5. Parallel rows of holes (2x5) in the ground with rows marked 2,3,4,5,6. A mancala board or bao board will do or holes in the dirt. (see https://youtu.be/tSTzOXu4f6k ) Students should have a notebook and pencil. *(optional but recommended if a CAV system is available to demo with) Mobile phone Course Summary \u00b6 This course will take you through several modules: Local economies - the communities we live in and our relationship to money Community Asset Voucher Creation - Social, political, and technical aspects of starting a CAV. Defining local commitments for redemption Introducing CAVs to the rest of community and world - Community engagement - Growing, using and maintaining a CAV Review and implement practical next steps Part 1. Local Economies \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 A Community Asset Voucher (CAV) is a tool that allows a community to develop their own credit system backed by local production. When used well it can enable trade and support local markets when national currency is scarce. When well maintained, a CAV can enable communities to reach a common vision. Like any tool, when not used responsibly, CAV has the potential to cause harm. The goal of the guide is to model how problems can occur, how to avoid harm, and how to design toward optimal usage. History \u00b6 Community groups of different types have been making currencies since before humans had written history. In fact, the first writing was an accounting record of wages of workers in Mesopotamia . CAVs come from a long history of grassroots economies and alternative monetary systems. There are many types of alternative financial systems throughout history in every area of the world. We recommend you see the following videos and if possible, have participants see some of these videos before coming to the session. Basic CAV Usage \u00b6 A core principle of CAVs is that community members have more goods and services to offer each other than they have national currency to buy them; that there is the potential for an abundance of both supply and demand that the community can fulfill for itself, if they had an adequate medium of exchange. Humanitarian organizations may purchase, create and distribute a CAV in order to support local trade during a crisis response. While community groups may create their own CAV in order to establish a local credit to stabilize and grow their economy and to facilitate local projects. Resource Mapping \u00b6 A CAV that is issued based on the sole backing of chapati and spent only on flour then re-spent on chapati alone may not help you prepare for a wedding or plan a community garden. Looking at the full (and potential) list of goods and services on offer and demand in a community and planning how a CAV will flow through those resources is very important. Understanding which of those resources are available locally and which are imported - as well as which are sold locally and which are exported will ultimately provide a roadmap toward a sustainable market. What defines local or community? What would happen if everyone in your community had a job? Is there enough work on farms, roads, houses and so on to give everyone security and full employment? If a community can come together with both their needs and abilities and resources this is possible. Community Asset Vouchers: Lecture and Discussion 30 Minutes \u00b6 Make sure everyone has a pen and paper to take notes. Say the following: The money (Shillings) we normally use is government-issued money. Money is an invention of a group of people who are willing to accept a certain type of token as a means of exchange. Throughout human history, people have used different media of exchange: shells, paper money, special rocks and gold coins. Money is just an agreement among people that something can represent a trade value. Hopefully you have seen some videos about community currencies. If not, I will share some links and we can see some during the breaks or after today. _A community currency is a voucher that can be used to trade in addition to the government issued money. Usually, communities use the measure of the government currency as a reference unit, for example, 1 CAV is redeemable for 1 Shilling worth of goods or services in Kenya. This makes it easy for communities to use an alternative without having to calculate exchange rates. _ Today, we are going to look at one form of community currency, called a CAVs. One quality is that a CAV can be used to fund community projects. Another quality is that they expire gradually over time in the form of a group fee. In all Community Currencies, it is the responsibility of the issuing community to care for and maintain the value of the currency, just as it is the government\u2019s responsibility to care for the value of the shilling. We all know it is dangerous when the government does not do a good job of preserving the value of the national currency. The exercises we do today are designed so you get to experience the way that a CAV works. You will get an understanding of how to use the currency and what problems you need to avoid if you want to continue to have a currency that is stable and serves the community. The following questions are designed to make sure the participants understand the basic ideas you have presented, and that they all start to participate in the discussion. Ask the following questions in order and allow several answers to each question before moving to the next: _Have you ever thought about where money comes from? _ How do you feel about creating a currency for your own community? Do businesses in the community experience cash flow problems? How is a voucher different from national currency? How do people in the community borrow money today? (Note: Probe for formal borrowing such as banks, Micro-Finance Institutions, Savings and Credit Cooperatives, and for informal borrowing \u2014such as borrowing from relatives or moneylenders, taking goods on credit.) _How easy and how fast is it to borrow from these sources? _ _What are the conditions for borrowing from these sources? _ Exercise: Knowing Our Community \u00b6 Materials \u00b6 White Board / Chalkboard / Flipchart Chalk / Markers Small White slips of paper Small Blue slips of paper (could be any color) Pen / Pencil for each participant Masking Tape (Or any tape to put something on the wall) Setup \u00b6 Give each player the following materials: Pen / Pencil 1 A4 sized white paper 6 medium sized white slips of paper (or numbers of your choosing) Beans = at least enough for 10 for each participant. These will have a value of 10 CAVs Introduction \u00b6 Say the following: _Having a shared goal and shared projects are important success factors for CAVs. In this exercise we are going to understand our community better. The purpose of the exercise is to understand what we could use the CAV to do in our community. _ Sometimes community currencies are printed like paper money, but today most community currencies are digital\u2014because most people now know how to use mobile money on their phones. CAV will generally be mobile or digital money but we will use paper and beans to signify our CAV today. This allows us to see where the entire supply of CAV is at all times, so we can understand how the money flow works. In this exercise, we are going to map our resources and needs. Then we will simulate trading with the paper and beans. At the end we will take account and discuss what happened. Step 1: Resource Mapping \u00b6 Needs: Identify all the needs people have in the community and trace their sources. What does the community import? (for example, money, flour) What about needs like emotional support, tree planting? Say: _Think about the needs of the community, including physical needs like petrol and flour. Also think of services like a boda boda ride or childcare, and care needs such as tending to someone ill. _ Write down on a piece of paper 2 or 3 of the needs and I will write them on the board here. Then collect the papers and write them on the board. Add a star each time the resource is repeated. Your board will look similar to this: >>>>> gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. ( Back to top )( Next alert ) >>>>> Ask: Which of these must be imported? Mark the ones that are imported rather than locally produced Ask the following questions and allow for discussion: What are the most common resources we identified? Are there any \u2018circular\u2019 trades or cycles where the money would stay within the community? _What happens to the national economy when there are more imports than exports _ _Leaking bucket idea: What happens when there is more water flowing out of a bucket than flowing in? _ Step 2. What can I offer? \u00b6 Say: Now we will look at what we can offer. Take a look at this list or think of other things that you provide the community. What services or items can you provide to help others fulfill their needs? If you don\u2019t have something right now, what could you provide in the future? _Please take the slips of white paper. Each paper will represent something you can sell to the community. On each piece of paper, write down something you are selling. Try to choose something that you can actually sell in the community. If you don\u2019t have something right now, you can just choose from the list so we can play the game. _ Step 3. Barter Credit \u00b6 In this exercise the group is going to trade in the beans, representing the CAV, for the goods they are trading, represented by slips of paper. Say: Remember, money is just an agreement between people. If we agree that beans are money, we can use them for trade. Imagine a trusted group of people in the community did the same: created a voucher, redeemable for their goods which we could use for a currency. We are now going to pretend that these beans are a kind of money. Each bean is worth 10 CAVs, and we are saying the CAV is equivalent to the shilling of goods or services. I will now give everyone 10 beans, to represent 100 CAVs. Make sure to count your beans so we all start out with the same number! Give each participant 10 beans (You can choose the number and adjust the text above). Have them count to make sure they got the same as everyone else. Now, look at your white slips of paper - you should have 4 slips. On the back, write down a price for that item. It needs to be multiples of 10 shillings, because we only have the beans for now. Keep the prices / units as small as possible to accommodate for the value of beans that were given. 10 beans represents 100 CAV so ideally your stock of goods or services is around there. Give them time to write on the back of each slip. Also do some slips for yourself, including one for a Boda ride. On the back, write down 50 etc. Now we are ready to trade. For example, I have a Boda ride (hold up the paper) _and on the back I wrote 50 (flip and show the back). If you want the ride, you give me 5 beans. I give you the slip with the Boda ride. If I still have more slips of paper (stock), I can give someone else a ride. _ This is simulating a market - try to sell your entire stock and spend your beans. _Now go around to one another and buy things you would normally buy. Everyone should make at least 5 trades. After you have made 5 trades, sit down, count your beans, and we will know we are done when everyone is back in their seat. _ Play for 5-10 minutes and finish 5 trades. Step 4. Community Trade Audit \u00b6 Set up a chart on the board with everyone\u2019s name. Say: Let\u2019s find out what happened. Everyone please count your beans. If you think you have the most, say out loud what you have. We will have the person with the most go and write their name and how much they have, and then so on with the next person who has the most. Have people call out their bean totals, and write their names with the number of beans they had, in order of the most beans to the least beans, on the board. >>>>> gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. ( Back to top )( Next alert ) >>>>> Discuss in the group: _What is interesting about the amounts? _ _The person at the top (name the name with the most beans) has a trade balance surplus of ____ CAV. (This is their bean balance minus the 10 they started with) That means that she didn\u2019t spend so much CAV in the community and sold a lot of her products or services. What could the community do to make sure she has more to buy? _ _ The people at the bottom (name the names with the least beans) have trade debits of ____ (their starting amount minus their balance). This means they did not offer goods or services that were in demand enough in the community. What could we do about that?_ Listen for ideas like bringing in additional people into the circle, training people for new professions, reducing consumption of things that are not produced locally, etc. Now, count what was purchased. You could do that by collecting slips or a raise of hands for what people bought. Item Amount Traded Number Non-local? Boda (Bike ride) 200 2 Water 200 2 Chapati (food) 400 4 Tomatoes 0 0 Petrol 200 2 * Discussion questions: What do these papers tell us about the trade in the community? What is interesting about the trades? _With the columns in mind, reflect on the daily needs. Are some, most, or all daily needs being met by what was traded? Is there anything missing? _ How would someone restock inventory that came from outside needing Kenyan Shillings? Discuss and write down a list of challenges, such as: Restocking Trust Distance between users People not knowing where to spend Holding too much CAV People changing CAV pricing Seasonal products The supply of CAV in this game was limited to only 100 CAV per person: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this small amount? Part 2. Community Asset Voucher Creation \u00b6 In the previous exercise many questions may have come up, such as what happens if you end up with too many CAVs. The types of question people may ask include: \u201cHow will I restock my shop with items that can only be bought in Kenyan Shillings?\u201d _Possible answers: Accept as much as you can spend on a daily or weekly basis. _ Accept as much as you would hold the debts of others. \u201cWhat if people spend CAV, then refuse to accept back CAVs?\u201d Issuers must redeem their vouchers if they don\u2019t seek dispute mediation In this section, we do exercises that show the trust and mutual stewardship that are required for having a successful CAV. Introducing a CAV is not a one-time event. Some communities refresh the CAV on an annual or bi-annual basis, deciding how to handle imbalances. Successful projects and community cohesion make your community a good candidate for further development. A community that knows how to care for its community currency can fulfill the long-term goals of the community. Community Currencies: Lecture and Discussion 30 Minutes \u00b6 Make sure everyone has a pen and paper to take notes. In the last exercise we have seen that a CAV needs to be managed properly such that the trade is balanced to some degree. Each person was issued with 100 CAV because they were backing it with 100 Ksh of their goods and services. If someone spent 100 CAV on tomatoes, while promising to redeem them later for shoe repair - they are pre-selling their shoe repair for tomatoes. _There are important elements I will discuss now and you can ask questions, then we will do some exercise to understand how this works. _ Community backing: without it, the CAV cannot work. Business people and community members make a promise of how much CAV they will accept, and for what goods and at what Kenyan Shillings value. For example, the shopkeeper might be willing to accept 2,000 CAV for 2,000 ksh worth of locally-grown vegetables. She might not be willing to accept any CAV or only a small percentage of the price in CAV for the packaged goods that are imported. We will do an exercise where all of us make promises of how much CAV we are willing to accept. _Committed community backing means that the CAV issuing community group is committed to redeeming any tokens they spend and maintaining a zero trade balance (spending = redemption) over time. In other words, the shopkeeper is committing to spending and accepting the CAVs with other community members, not just spending or accepting them. _ _Commitments of goods and services serve several purposes. They limit how many CAVs can be created while also allowing CAVs to be exchanged for those goods and services. _ You can imagine the reserve of commitments as a seed bank, at which, after a deposit of seeds you get a share slip (CAV) that allows you to pull seeds back out in the future. When there are very few seeds in the bank then there are very few CAVs in circulation. Of course, nothing will compensate for people who spend CAV but don\u2019t accept it back. So there are some important ways that you as community members will need to take care of your currency and we will also have a discussion about what would work for your group after we do that exercise. Important caution: If you continue to care for the CAV properly, you will have a long-term economic impact to create an independent community. If you treat a CAV as \u201cfree money\u201d and are careless, the CAV circulation will slow and eventually stop flowing and also create resentment against the people who took advantage of the situation at other people\u2019s expense. Exercise: Community Commitment \u00b6 In this exercise, the community will explore the levels of commitment of the participants in the community currency. You will be asking people to really think about what they can commit and accept if the community were to adopt a CAV, so these commitments should be \u201creal\u201d in that the participants will be able to actually accept and spend CAV if the project goes forward. The participants should see themselves as the CAV issuing group who own the program and will be starting the circulation of their CAV in the community. At this point, people may be experiencing some level of skepticism about whether this will work, and whether they may end up losing money or products while accepting the CAV. This is normal. Allow them to express those concerns and then try the exercises. After the exercises, have an open discussion to have them discuss their concerns and see how they can support one another to address the issues that might come up. Materials \u00b6 Small paper (half an A4 or a large index card) 1 per player Large Paper (full sheet of A4) 1 per 2 player Easel-sized / Flipchart Paper (a few sheets for the room) Writing implements for everyone While slips of paper. At least a 4 for each participant. These will represent commitments of goods and services with a Kenyan Shilling value. Beans, at least 25 for each participant, (these could be replaced with pieces of colored paper with a 100 CAV written on it) These beans will be redeemable for 2,500 KSH of goods and services A timepiece for tracking rounds. Setup \u00b6 Keep participants in the same groups from the previous step. Hand out 4 small, blank slips of white paper to each participant Provide fresh sheets of A4 paper if needed. Roles for the Exercise \u00b6 In this and the following exercises, the group will need people to play certain roles. People can try different roles in different exercises. Following are the roles that are needed: Chama Representative: Inspect the slips of paper to verify that the person actually has those goods and services to trade and that the amount should not exceed 1 months sales capacity or 10% of their annual sales capacity (once completed); this includes community projects. distribute each member some CAV based on their audit Mediate disputes Collect a holding tax - each month collect 2% of everyone\u2019s CAVs Introduction \u00b6 The exercises above allowed the community to experiment with exchanging in a system with a CAV and holding taxes. To have a currency in a real community, there is a minimum amount of worth of committed goods and services as well as needed endorsements. In the next exercise, we will take a look at the minimum requirements of the community and start to speculate whether they could have a CAV. Keep the groups for this part and say: _Now we need a name and abbreviation for the CAV. Kenyan Shillings are called Shillings and the abbreviation is KES. You could make any name for your currency. For each long name, we also want a short name we can use. The short name should be less than 6 letters. _ The name we chose now is just for this workshop today. If you like it, you can keep it for your CAV in the future, but you do not have to, so just have fun thinking of names we can use today. In your groups, I will give 5 minutes to create a name and an abbreviation. For example, you could have a token called Wanoma and the abbreviation could be NOMA. Please take 5 minutes now in your groups. After 5 minutes, stop the action. Have each group say the name and abbreviation and write it on the board. Have the group vote for a name. How many vouchers to create? \u00b6 The amount of CAV a group can created depends on two things: Community commitment: The amount of commitments of goods and services that members of a group have pledged to redeem for CAV. An audit of the community's ability to fulfill their commitments. No more than 10% of the annual sale capacity of the group or month\u2019s sale capacity will be accepted in order to ensure there is more than enough baking for a CAV. Endorsement from local Village Elders. The maximum number of CAVs that can be created is limited based on a reserve requirement of 100% of community commitments. So with 50,000 Ksh worth of audited commitments a community can create 50,000 of their own CAV tokens. This is a good starting point for a community. Note that yearly this commitment process can be redone to reassess the needed CAV supply. While the number of CAV to create is important, the speed of circulation is even more crucial to maintaining a local market. There should be enough CAVs in circulation, such that the community can maintain the amount of trade it desires. Who should create a CAV? \u00b6 CAVs are not short term projects - as they seek to provide sustainable public financial infrastructure. CAVs seek to be an alternative when national currencies are scarce and hence provide a safety net for communities in crisis. Creating a Community Asset Voucher is like having a baby - it is a responsibility that one should not walk away from. It is of utmost importance that the community backing be as solid as possible with the full support of the community, mediators, elders and chief. Trustful communities can build wealth much easier than trustless communities. It's not only about how hard you work, but how much of your work is lost through cheating, theft, corruption, and providing security against those things. Trust and trustworthiness are themselves forms of wealth. Explain the CAV creation rules. Say: In real life to launch a community currency, these groups must be at least 1 year old, at least 10 members who are active, there must be a minimum of 50,000 ksh in commitments with an audit to show capacity, this training course, a signed application. If you can meet the requirements, the Grassroots Economics Foundation can support in creating the CAV. _Did we reach the 50,000 KSH total or 2,500 KSH each in commitments? _ _How balanced are the commitments? _ If we didn\u2019t have enough, how could your community reach 50,000 KSH in commitments? Who else would you want to join? Does the committed group have any potential for circular trade with each other? Are you satisfied with what you decided to put in the community backing? If others had written higher or lower numbers, would it have influenced you to give more or less? Do you have a different way or better way to come to a decision like this? Is this a fair and equitable way of making this decision? What, if anything, could have made this process better? _Who needs to be in the initial commitment agreement? _ How should the group and greater community enforce this agreement? Who will arbitrate challenges and should also sign the agreement? Say: Think back to when we played through making a CAV. During that exercise I gave some of you sheets or paper that had goods and services on them. You used those goods as your commitment to make a CAV. Now I want you to think about your real community. What goods or services does your community have to back a CAV with? For example, vegetables, land, a water source, a taxi service. _Right now, it is a good idea to think about things you really could commit to backing your CAV. If you have a retail business, you might be willing to sell 20% of your items for CAV and use those for other things in the community. _ _For the exercise ensure that the total value of all our inventory doesn\u2019t exceed 2,500 Kenyan shillings of goods and services. These will be how many CAVs you are allocated. In reality the amount you are willing to back a CAV with should not exceed a month of your sales capacity or 10% of your annual sales capacity. _ Step 1. Commitments \u00b6 _When we played through using a CAV before. Remember that when you committed goods to back the CAV, you then had to sell those for CAV during the trading exercise. This is what it means to commit to selling an item or service for CAV. Now that we think about what we might do for our community, it requires a commitment. This commitment comes from you and other business people in the community. _ _In order to be able to spend the CAV - What would you be willing to commit to selling in return for the CAV? For the exercise, we will be committing 2,500 shillings worth of goods or services each, but if we were doing a real-life commitment, the community would need to reach at least 50,000 KES of commitments and not exceed 10% of your annual or one month of your sales capacity. _ Everyone should contribute 2500 shillings worth of commitments. That means, you have 2500 shillings worth of goods or services to sell and accept the CAV. _Now write down some goods and services on each piece of paper. You can use the ones we had before or other goods. _ Give everyone 25 slips of paper and have them write down the items they sell. For instance a woman selling chapati only can write chapati on each 25 slips of paper and the amount of 100 /= on each one. Meaning she has a total inventory worth 2500/= Give everyone a few minutes to write down the goods on their small slips of paper. Step 2. Filling Commitment Table \u00b6 Use the following Commitment Table to put everyone\u2019s commitments on the board. Commitment Table Name Product sold Commitment in product value (KSH) CAV received Joyce Water 400 400 Janet Sugar 400 400 Jacob Maize flour 400 400 Mwanaidi Rice 400 400 Phred Phone 400 400 Amina Kuni 400 400 Mbui Maji 400 400 Vivian Boda 400 400 Njambi Mboga 400 400 Nadzua Maji Project 400 400 Total 4,000 4,000 _This table is called the Commitment Table. When you make a commitment to a real CAV, this is how it will work. You say what you will commit; For example, (Sally) will provide 2,500 KSH worth of (chapatis worth 10ksh each) in return for 2,500 CAVs. Once the commitment is signed and verified Sally will be issued 2,500 CAVs she can spend with others. _ _Are there questions about this? We will be playing a game to show how it works. _ We would like one person to be responsible for the reserve and the contract. Who will do that? Step 3. Issue CAV \u00b6 Have the Chama Rep. inspect the Commitment Table and validate that each persons inventory amount then hand that person 1 bean for every 100 KSH worth of inventory. Now calculate how many total commitments there will be. The commitments should be the number of people playing times 2,500 if each person committed to 2,500. _We will be issuing [xxx total commitments] CAVs. _ Step 4. Trade \u00b6 Now, we will do another few rounds of trading like we did in the beginning Let\u2019s do 5 rounds of trade together. _The Chama Rep. will not be trading during this round. _ Have them do 5 rounds of trade. Then, as in the beginning, do a chart to see where the money went. Player Wanoma (CAV name) Mwanaidi 1000 Amina 800 Njambi 600 Jacob 600 Mbui 400 Janet 200 Nadzua 200 Phred 100 Joy 100 Viv 0 Totals 4000 What happened as a result of the CAVs? Was there a change in the amount of economic activity? Does the amount of CAVs created initially (as in the previous exercise) make sense? What is the importance of the social backing and commitment of the issuers here? Step 5. Expiration Rates \u00b6 At this point, the group should have the general idea of how the trades work. Now, it\u2019s useful to understand how taxation works. Let everyone keep the CAVs as they had them in the last exercise. Following are scenarios to try. You can also have the group come up with scenarios to try. Say: _Because we want to ensure that no one will hold CAVs too long and want the Chama to continue to support projects and the circulation of CAV, we want to appreciate their efforts. We can do this through a holding tax - similar to a group fee. _ _Everyone holding beans at the end of the month must give some beans to the Chama Treasurer. _ Note that in reality this would not exceed 2% a month. For this exercise for every 100 CAV (10 beans) (roughly every 6 months) you hold give one to the Chama Treasurer Let the Chama Treasurer go around and collect a bean from each player for each 10 beans they are holding (round down). Then show the results, as in the tables before. Player CAV holdings Holding Tax (after 6 months) Mwanaidi 1000 100 Amina 800 80 Njambi 600 60 Jacob 600 60 Mbui 400 40 Janet 200 20 Nadzua 200 20 Phred 100 10 Joy 100 10 Viv 0 0 Totals 4000 400 Ask the following questions and give time for discussion. _What happened here? _ What would the Chama Rep. do with the 400 CAV it collected? Could some be given to the village elders? What would the village elders do with the CAV? Could some be used to support the chama board or community projects? Does this tax help ensure people don\u2019t spend and that the system is supported by the Chamas and Village Elders? If the group creates 50,000 CAV and this holding tax were taken continuously and resulted in 2% (1000) going back to the chama monthly, would that be too much or too little? You can run additional experiments with different roles, depending on the amount of time that you have and the concerns of the groups. Examples of roles that people could take: Someone with nothing to trade who is being given CAV from the project (elderly, for example). Someone who is taking advantage of the system and cashing out as much as possible. Someone who does not honor their commitment to receive CAV. After each round, you can discuss what happened. You don\u2019t always need to make a board of the totals when it is obvious what happened as a result of the game. Part 3. Introducing CAVs to the rest of community and world \u00b6 In this section, there will be discussions and exercises to explore how well the participants understand CAVs and to present some potential worst-case scenarios. At the end of the section, they should be prepared to go back to their communities, train others, and develop community agreements. Understanding the Risks \u00b6 A CAV is not meant to be a store of value, it is a tool for facilitating local trade. Holding onto a CAV is like holding onto a piece of the economy: It has more value if it is traded and accepted. If someone sells all their imported inventory for CAVs and can\u2019t buy any more stock their business could collapse. Obligations \u00b6 _It is up to all of the participants to monitor themselves and the other members, and make sure that people are keeping their commitments to accept CAVs. If people are not accepting CAVs for goods in the communities, nobody will want to hold them, and people will stop accepting them. _ How do you feel about your community\u2019s ability to keep their word and accept the CAVs that they have created? Are there people who you think are more or less likely to keep the agreement? What would you do to make sure that everyone who commits actually keeps the commitment? Dispute Mitigation \u00b6 _Should you create and spend CAVs you are obligated to accept them back. The CAV Commitment Agreement should state the repercussions and they should be enforceable by the group and local authorities. There are many possible cases where disputes will arise such as CAVs being stolen or someone refusing to accept more after spending. All of these cases need to be thought through before they happen. We will now discuss some worst case scenarios, so you can be prepared and think about how to put in place agreements to prevent these problems or to mitigate the risks if something goes wrong. _ Worst Case Scenarios \u00b6 Mention each scenario and then give people time to discuss. Someone convinces Mama Sammy to accept CAV for all her stock of sugar and she can no longer buy her stock as she needs national currency. It is taking too long for someone to redeem their CAV in goats after spending them. Someone collects CAV in a devious way and then spends it all on an unsuspecting shop owner and never accepts it back. One of the committed backers spends all their CAV in another community. The community project funds are not fairly distributed to people for work. The project managers play favorites or fund people who aren\u2019t really doing the work. Balancing Inventory \u00b6 Anyone using a CAV, especially those who aren\u2019t issuers, will have the same question, \u201cIf I accept CAV where will I spend it and how will I restock or buy things that need Kenyan Shillings\u201d. For a CAV issuer starting with a lump sum of CAV the answer is simple, accept back at least as much as you have spent - then spend more and repeat. But for a business accepting it for the first time the following are suggested answers If you as an issuer are trying to convince someone to accept it - you have to point them to where they can spend it - ideally back at your businesses or others in the issuer group, or at other users that have begun to accept it. If that is not an option for them and they need things that simply can\u2019t be found in the network and they have yet to enroll their suppliers, they have some options: They can be careful and accept only as much CAV as they know they can spend on other expenses. Often this means only accepting as much as your profit margins on items you must restock in national currency. Only accepting as much as you might accept informal debts from others. There should be a limit on how much you will sell goods or services on credit. As a group, it is up to you to make sure there are active members and if there are particular services or items in demand, you can find people who sell those things and invite them to join. Exercise: Balancing Inventory \u00b6 To manage businesses wisely, participants in the CAV need to do inventory balancing. If you are selling something that can\u2019t be purchased with CAV and accepting CAVs for it you must make up that loss in some other way--such as saving national currency on the purchase of daily food for your family. For example, if you accept 400 CAV for an imported product you are selling you must spend 400 CAV on something that will save you having to spend 400 in National currency - so that you can still purchase your stock. We will now do an exercise to show how that works. Have someone role play as a shop that sells something that can\u2019t be purchased for CAV (yet). Determine how often you buy stock and how much you buy it for and sell it for: (For example, Coca Cola. Once a month you buy for 20 shillings a bottle and you sell it for 40 shillings a bottle. ) How much CAV can you use daily in the community? How much CAV can you accept per bottle? Would you set a different price in shillings than you would in CAV? What would happen to the demand for local drinks as opposed to Coca-Cola as the CAV becomes more popular? Is that good for the community? How important are imported products? What types of businesses can accept the most CAVs? Takeaway: The individuals can see for themselves how to calculate the amount of CAV they can accept for different products and services (local and imported). External Support for a CAV \u00b6 CAVs are vouchers redeemable for goods and services, and like any voucher they can also be bought and sold. Someone might want to buy your CAV in order to give it to someone as a gift. Humanitarian Organizations might do this as well; buy an amount of CAV from the issuers and donate them to needy people in the community. A purchaser of a CAV is paying in advance for goods or services that the CAV is redeemable for. A CAV issuer should treat the purchase of a CAV as a pre-sale - since the CAV will eventually come back to them for redemption in goods and services. By donating purchased CAVs to the community rather than money directly - this is a way to ensure that the funds at least double their effectiveness in the community - by buying local goods or services and ensuring that those goods or services are consumed locally by those in need. Because all the transactions of a CAV are transparent a donor can tell if the CAV has been redeemed. If the CAV continues to circulate in the community, being redeemed and reissued or purchased then the impact of the support becomes multiplied. This is what we call the multiplier effect of CAVs; rather than typical aid that ends up in the hands of people living outside the community. When thinking about who could buy or accept your CAV, think about who might want or need your goods or services and be willing to preorder it. Which agencies, government or other, exist in the region? What programs exist in the region that can align with the group mandate? Which industries exist in the region where members can add value to their supply line? Reflections after the course \u00b6 Ask the participants to talk about what questions CAVs and the exercises bring about. This sheet is based on Elinor \u00d6strom\u2019s Commons Governance Rules . Who is part of a CAV and who is not? What are the rules for joining? ( Define clear group boundaries .) Are the rules governing CAV creation and usage locally appropriate? ( Match rules governing groups and the use of community resources to local needs and conditions .) Who can participate in modifying those rules? ( Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules.) How are CAV rules legitimate outside the community or group creating them? ( Make sure the rule-making rights of the community members are respected by outside authorities .) How are CAV member behaviours and rule compliance monitored? ( Develop a system, carried out by the community to monitor member\u2019s behaviour such as trade balance. ) How are CAV related disputes resolved in the community? ( Provide accessible low-cost means for dispute resolution.) What kind of governance layers are there for maintaining CAVs? ( Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the base level to the entire ecosystem. ) Next Steps \u00b6 Read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and test your knowledge with the CAV Quiz. Ensure your chama meets all the criteria and understands this material. Develop a CAV Commitment Agreement and have it audited by Grassroots Economics and the local administration. Contact info@grassecon.org or dial +254757628885 If approved your CAVs will be distributed as per the agreement. Start trading and building your community and economy! Appendix A: CAV Commitment Agreement Template \u00b6 _Note: Community acceptance, usage and the value of a CAV starts with the issuer backing and vision. This backing is audited and a document as described below must be approved by mediators, the local chief and elders. CAV issuers that spend their CAV in the community must accept it back and are considered in debt until they do so. The following is an example of a statement of commitment and intention to develop a CAV. _ In order to certify and support a community to create a CAV, Grassroots Economics\u2019 CAV Creation criteria requires groups creating a CAV to have a: Initial registration as a group at least 1 year ago Minimum 10 members with active membership Have a minimum commitments of 50,000 Ksh of goods and services Demonstrable backing capacity for tokens created. (Business audit) Have the endorsement of a community official or village elder. Have a leading member that has gone through this training. A completed Voucher application form - Please inquire for specific forms. Appendix B: CAV Technology \u00b6 Community Asset Vouchers CAVs are digital tokens residing on a public ledger. CAVs accounts can be accessed on feature phones without the internet. In Kenya you can dial 384 96# on Safaricom or 483 46# on Airtel to register your account and set a password. Note that any personal information you share, such as your products and PIN are considered private and confidential. Should you lose your pin you can dial 0757628885 to reach Sarafu Network support.

Appendix C: Income Generating Activities (IGAs) \u00b6 Quite often IGAs are developed by an CAV issuing group as one of the primary backers of a CAV. It is important to fully understand how to set up an IGA for use with a CAV. This is similar to running a business while using vouchers or coupons. Upon creating a CAV a group will have clear commitments to redeeming them for goods and services. A community project or IGA can be a major source of commitments to backing a CAV. Below are some things to consider: Business What are your products/services? Who are your clients? Who are your distributors? Who are your suppliers? (Name three) What are the supplier\u2019s qualifications? What are their costs for products and delivery? Where are they located? Finances What is the product price? What does your competitor charge? What is the Market Rate? How do customers pay in CAV and national currency (minimum or maximum CAV) What is your revenue? e.g total sales (daily monthly yearly?) What are your costs? e.g rent, electricity, transport. (daily, monthly, yearly?) What is the profit margin? Management Who is doing the quality control? In a community project, committee members, group officials can take roles in quality control. Ensuring expected standards are met. Who is ensuring duties and responsibilities are met by employees? Who is going to be selling the product? Who manages the project / funds And what that person does with funds? How is additional investment or maintenance managed? E.g. buying a water tank or pump for a borehole project? Who are your stakeholders? What are your strategies on how to deal with emerging issues e.g cheating Are you in compliance with local law? Are there any conflicts of interest? (e.g. your ONLY supplier is running the IGA) Water project example \u00b6 Below example shows an estimation plan of a water vending business. Business What are your products/services? Selling water Who are your clients? Everyone who buys water Who are your distributors? Mkokoteni - Bob, Jim, Sally Who are your suppliers? (Name three) Kimwaso water, city water, George, Rain water harvesting What are the supplier\u2019s qualifications? Kimwaso is the best water we all agree What are their costs for products and delivery? KSh 3000 is the cost for refilling a 5000 litre tank. Where are they located? All over the area Finances What is the product price? 1 jerrican =20 litres 5000/20 = 250 jerrican (Total number of jerrican) 3000/250 to know the cost of 1 jerry can 1 jerry can = ksh12 (cost) 12. What does your competitor charge? What is the Market Rate? ksh 20 for 1 jerry can (20ltr jerry can) Market price How do customers pay in CAV and national currency (minimum or maximum CAV) The profit per jerrycan will be buying price minus selling price which is Ksh 20 - 12 = Ksh 8 This is how much is expected when selling 1 jerry can for ksh15 and 5CAV What is your revenue? e.g total sales (daily monthly yearly?) Revenue per tank Ksh 15 * 250 = 3750 CAV 5 * 250 = 1250 What are your costs? e.g rent, electricity, transport. (daily monthly yearly?) What is the profit margin? Profit margin Ksh 3750 - Ksh 3000 = Ksh750 CAV 1250 Ksh. 3000 will be used to refill water in the water tank. Management Who is doing the quality control? In a community project, committee members, group officials can take roles in quality control. Ensuring expected standards are met. Chairperson Jim Who is ensuring duties and responsibilities are met by employees? Who is going to be selling the product and what are their wages? Bob and Sally Who manages the project / funds And what that person does with funds? Wage Percentage. For this case, wages will be paid after let's say first round refill. Employee on duty will get a percentage in both CAV and Ksh. Quality check officer E.g Sally 20%- 20% of ksh 750 = Ksh 150 20% of 1250 = CAV 250 Labour Mbui 30% 30% of ksh. 750 = Ksh 225 30% of ksh CAV 375 Chama - 50% 50% of ksh 750 = Ksh 375 50% of ksh 1250 = CAV 675 34. 6.Chama Fund Chama\u2019s percentage can be used in the following ways.

What are your strategies on how to deal with emerging issues e.g cheating Are you in compliance with local law? Are there any conflicts of interest? (e.g. your ONLY supplier is running the IGA) _The community projects are where the CAV helps you improve your community much more than just putting money in circulation. The best thing about these community projects is that the CAV gives you the opportunity to decide for yourselves what projects are most important, and to pay your local townspeople for doing those projects. It might be planting trees, building a health center, educating the children\u2014whatever you think is most important. You do not rely on someone outside to tell you what projects to do. Instead you yourselves make decisions about what is best for your community. _ Appendix D: Projects and Purpose of the CAV \u00b6 Note that instead of simply backing a CAV with the audited goods and services of the issuing group. The group could decide to back the CAV with the outputs from a community project. This is more risky as the auditing process is much harder - as a village elder must assess the ability of the group to fulfill the redemption requirement on the vouchers. In this exercise, the group will discuss the needs of the community and consider projects or income generating activities that they could do together. You can do this in small groups of 4 or 5, or in the classroom together. You can have them form groups themselves or count off to create more random groups. Say: We are now going to explore what it would be like for you to create and use a CAV for your community. As I mentioned before, when we create the CAV, we create a currency we can use for trade\u2014but also we can create surplus credit that can go towards projects. In your small groups, discuss what you think the community needs and the goals for the community. Examples might be delivering a local service, providing basic needs, education scholarships, growing the economy, helping the needy\u2014it is up to you what your goals could be. Have one person write your ideas. I will give you 5 minutes. After 5 minutes have them stop and say: _ That was the first part. Now, thinking about the goals that you wrote down, consider in your group some projects you would want to fund to reach those goals. Projects could be one-time projects, such as building a health center or planting trees, or every-day projects such as collecting garbage or education. Have one person write the ideas. Again, I will give you 5 minutes._ After 5 minutes, have them stop. Have a group discussion with the purpose of determining the top ideas and projects that the group would initially want to fund. First, write down the ideas of the purpose of the CAV on the board, or have all the lists posted on the board. Have the group discuss the ideas and reach a consensus about the purpose. Addendum \u00b6 Best Practice \u00b6 While this agreement establishes the relationship with the applicant, and the Service provider - It is recommended that the Applicant Kibuyu have clear internal agreements and documentation on the following: Kibuyu cohesion: Ensure your Kibuyu membership has a clear vision, aims & objectives and community statement. Needs assessment: Identify and prioritise the pressing needs of the community. Partners: Identify local stakeholders, partners and programs in alignment with the Kibuyu aims and objectives. Distribution : Establish how the proceeds of Sarafu issuance will be used, including any fees or levies, distribution or loaning to members or group projects. Loans and Repayment: If Sarafu are subject to redemption at a specified date or rate, there should be a clear productive purpose for the resulting debt, a repayment period and a clear mechanism including levies for non-performance. Trade Balance: Members should be required to accept as many Sarafu as they spend in a timely manner and be subject to levies. Projects: Any Kibuyu funded projects should be well planned and a designated manager put in charge. (E.g. Issuing Sarafu to fund community support for vulnerable households and community gardens.) Cycles: There should be a clearing cycle wherein all Sarafu are returned to the Applicant group account, credit obligations settled and a new Sarafu issuance made. If the Kibuyu is a chama this can match their loan funding cycles. Market/Meeting Days: Regular meeting and/or market days (e.g. weekly) should be mandatory - where members meet to trade, discuss and compare Sarafu balances openly and attempt to reduce high balances and increase low balances. Balance limits: Members should have clear limits to how many Sarafu they hold for business purposes and should not accumulate excessive Sarafu reserves.","title":"Training Guide"},{"location":"edu/training/#community-asset-voucher-cav-and-commitment-pooling-field-guide","text":"","title":"Community Asset Voucher (CAV) and Commitment Pooling Field Guide"},{"location":"edu/training/#how-to-use-this-guide","text":"This guide is designed to give communities a feel for how Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) work.

Participants are members of a community who are interested in having a CAV in their community. The ideal group size for this training is (5-10ppl). We recommend that the first CAV training be given to participants who are respected in the community and who can encourage others to participate in the CAV as it is released. The course can be given to community leaders, businesses, group members, CAV designers, design challenge participants, students, humanitarian aid workers and volunteers. Participants who have an understanding of the local context and markets in which a CAV will be implemented will be best prepared to develop their own CAVs. Generally, the course is targeted at chamas or other savings and mutual aid groups. The trainer does not have to belong to the group that is being trained. The exercises in this guide are useful for communities where CAVs have been airdropped or granted, either before the community tries the CAV or at the end of the experiment with the initial CAV. Using an initial token like SRF in the Sarafu-Network will allow communities to better understand the specific challenges and advantages for their communities, and set up the proper checks and balances to make sure their own CAV is more successful if they do choose to launch a local CAV. Upon completion of the training, all of the participants should understand the training lessons and be prepared to make a decision about whether to move forward in additional education or in the implementation of a CAV in their community. After participating in this training, some of the participants will be capable of using and developing a CAV and training other community members. The trajectory of the training and the CAVs in general is to empower communities to take on the responsibility for their own financial well-being and economic growth.","title":"Audience"},{"location":"edu/training/#purpose-of-the-training","text":"Groups using or creating Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) need to understand benefits, obligations and risks - as do supporting organizations and training groups.

You can think of a CAV as an interest-free funding mechanism that can jump-start resilient economies. CAV\u2019s enable money that is used for projects to continue to circulate in the economy, rather than being used up as the project completes.

When users register on the network they are automatically given some SRF to use as an introduction to the CAV concept and technology. SRF is a CAV that is created by Grassroots Economics and used for training and CAV related services. Grassroots Economics is partnering with organizations such as the Red Cross to provide support for CAV programs. SRF is granted to communities throughout Kenya. These grants, sometimes called Airdrops, will serve as a trial for communities to experiment with the CAV before determining whether they would like to launch their own CAV. SRF used to teach people the basic CAV concepts. The SRF injection offers the following benefits to communities receiving the grants: Actual experience with a CAV before creating their own. Injection of credit (SRF) that can be used by local people to pay for their expenses. Encouragement of local economic activity. Infusion of funds that goes where the people want it to go, encouraging independence rather than dependence. Statistics on the usage of the SRF. When it becomes time to implement their own CAV, these communities will have actual data on how SRF was used and they can determine the correct local policies based on real data. However, the injection of SRF or any CAV also poses some risks to the communities, so it is important that there be some education about CAVs. Potential risks: If people misuse the CAV, some individuals may lose money, goods or services. People could become disillusioned with the use of alternative currencies rather than learning lessons for improvement. Communities may come to expect that charities will purchase CAVs with no strings attached, encouraging dependence on aid agencies.

Say the following: The money (Shillings) we normally use is government-issued money. Money is an invention of a group of people who are willing to accept a certain type of token as a means of exchange. Throughout human history, people have used different media of exchange: shells, paper money, special rocks and gold coins. Money is just an agreement among people that something can represent a trade value. Hopefully you have seen some videos about community currencies. If not, I will share some links and we can see some during the breaks or after today. _A community currency is a voucher that can be used to trade in addition to the government issued money. Usually, communities use the measure of the government currency as a reference unit, for example, 1 CAV is redeemable for 1 Shilling worth of goods or services in Kenya. This makes it easy for communities to use an alternative without having to calculate exchange rates. _ Today, we are going to look at one form of community currency, called a CAVs. One quality is that a CAV can be used to fund community projects. Another quality is that they expire gradually over time in the form of a group fee. In all Community Currencies, it is the responsibility of the issuing community to care for and maintain the value of the currency, just as it is the government\u2019s responsibility to care for the value of the shilling.

In the last exercise we have seen that a CAV needs to be managed properly such that the trade is balanced to some degree. Each person was issued with 100 CAV because they were backing it with 100 Ksh of their goods and services. If someone spent 100 CAV on tomatoes, while promising to redeem them later for shoe repair - they are pre-selling their shoe repair for tomatoes. _There are important elements I will discuss now and you can ask questions, then we will do some exercise to understand how this works. _ Community backing: without it, the CAV cannot work. Business people and community members make a promise of how much CAV they will accept, and for what goods and at what Kenyan Shillings value. For example, the shopkeeper might be willing to accept 2,000 CAV for 2,000 ksh worth of locally-grown vegetables. She might not be willing to accept any CAV or only a small percentage of the price in CAV for the packaged goods that are imported. We will do an exercise where all of us make promises of how much CAV we are willing to accept. _Committed community backing means that the CAV issuing community group is committed to redeeming any tokens they spend and maintaining a zero trade balance (spending = redemption) over time. In other words, the shopkeeper is committing to spending and accepting the CAVs with other community members, not just spending or accepting them. _ _Commitments of goods and services serve several purposes. They limit how many CAVs can be created while also allowing CAVs to be exchanged for those goods and services. _ You can imagine the reserve of commitments as a seed bank, at which, after a deposit of seeds you get a share slip (CAV) that allows you to pull seeds back out in the future. When there are very few seeds in the bank then there are very few CAVs in circulation. Of course, nothing will compensate for people who spend CAV but don\u2019t accept it back. So there are some important ways that you as community members will need to take care of your currency and we will also have a discussion about what would work for your group after we do that exercise. Important caution: If you continue to care for the CAV properly, you will have a long-term economic impact to create an independent community. If you treat a CAV as \u201cfree money\u201d and are careless, the CAV circulation will slow and eventually stop flowing and also create resentment against the people who took advantage of the situation at other people\u2019s expense.","title":"Community Currencies: Lecture and Discussion 30 Minutes"},{"location":"edu/training/#exercise-community-commitment","text":"In this exercise, the community will explore the levels of commitment of the participants in the community currency.

So with 50,000 Ksh worth of audited commitments a community can create 50,000 of their own CAV tokens. This is a good starting point for a community. Note that yearly this commitment process can be redone to reassess the needed CAV supply.

CAVs seek to be an alternative when national currencies are scarce and hence provide a safety net for communities in crisis.

It is of utmost importance that the community backing be as solid as possible with the full support of the community, mediators, elders and chief. Trustful communities can build wealth much easier than trustless communities. It's not only about how hard you work, but how much of your work is lost through cheating, theft, corruption, and providing security against those things. Trust and trustworthiness are themselves forms of wealth. Explain the CAV creation rules. Say: In real life to launch a community currency, these groups must be at least 1 year old, at least 10 members who are active, there must be a minimum of 50,000 ksh in commitments with an audit to show capacity, this training course, a signed application.

Who else would you want to join? Does the committed group have any potential for circular trade with each other? Are you satisfied with what you decided to put in the community backing? If others had written higher or lower numbers, would it have influenced you to give more or less? Do you have a different way or better way to come to a decision like this?

What, if anything, could have made this process better? _Who needs to be in the initial commitment agreement? _ How should the group and greater community enforce this agreement? Who will arbitrate challenges and should also sign the agreement? Say: Think back to when we played through making a CAV. During that exercise I gave some of you sheets or paper that had goods and services on them. You used those goods as your commitment to make a CAV. Now I want you to think about your real community. What goods or services does your community have to back a CAV with? For example, vegetables, land, a water source, a taxi service. _Right now, it is a good idea to think about things you really could commit to backing your CAV. If you have a retail business, you might be willing to sell 20% of your items for CAV and use those for other things in the community. _ _For the exercise ensure that the total value of all our inventory doesn\u2019t exceed 2,500 Kenyan shillings of goods and services.

But for a business accepting it for the first time the following are suggested answers If you as an issuer are trying to convince someone to accept it - you have to point them to where they can spend it - ideally back at your businesses or others in the issuer group, or at other users that have begun to accept it. If that is not an option for them and they need things that simply can\u2019t be found in the network and they have yet to enroll their suppliers, they have some options: They can be careful and accept only as much CAV as they know they can spend on other expenses.

Once a month you buy for 20 shillings a bottle and you sell it for 40 shillings a bottle. ) How much CAV can you use daily in the community? How much CAV can you accept per bottle? Would you set a different price in shillings than you would in CAV? What would happen to the demand for local drinks as opposed to Coca-Cola as the CAV becomes more popular?

The best thing about these community projects is that the CAV gives you the opportunity to decide for yourselves what projects are most important, and to pay your local townspeople for doing those projects. It might be planting trees, building a health center, educating the children\u2014whatever you think is most important. You do not rely on someone outside to tell you what projects to do.

The group could decide to back the CAV with the outputs from a community project. This is more risky as the auditing process is much harder - as a village elder must assess the ability of the group to fulfill the redemption requirement on the vouchers. In this exercise, the group will discuss the needs of the community and consider projects or income generating activities that they could do together. You can do this in small groups of 4 or 5, or in the classroom together. You can have them form groups themselves or count off to create more random groups.

As approaches to consultation and disclosure change from a short term means of meeting regulatory and donor requirements, to a longer-term, more strategic channel for relationship-building, risk mitigation, and new business identification, new approaches and forms of engagement are evolving. This document serves as a best practice guide for implementing agencies on how to effectively engage stakeholders in the community. The guide aims to provide the reader with the good practice \u201cessentials\u201d for managing stakeholder relationships in a dynamic context, where unexpected events can and do occur, and facts on the ground change. Stakeholder engagement is a continuous process between the Implementing agency and those potentially benefiting from the Implementation of Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs). This process will span through the entire timeline of the project. The focus of this handbook is on Stakeholder groups \u201cexternal\u201d to the core operation of the business, such as affected communities, local government authorities, non-governmental and other civil society organizations, local institutions and other interested or affected parties. We have not addressed engagement with suppliers, contractors, distributors, or customers, because interaction with these parties is a core business function and subject to national regulations and/or established policies and procedures. The handbook is divided into two parts. Part One contains the key concepts and principles of stakeholder engagement, the practices that are known to work, and the tools to support the delivery of effective stakeholder engagement. Part Two shows how these principles, practices, and tools fit with the different phases of the project cycle, from initial concept, through program design and operations, to Implementation and/or Exit Strategy. Each of these phases presents different environmental and social risks and opportunities for the project and, as such, different practices in stakeholder engagement need to be employed and integrated into management systems at each stage. Please note This guide is meant as a handbook for best practices. It is essential that implementing agencies design and implement their own strategies determined by the specific geographical location in line with their specific needs and requirements. For this reason, readers are encouraged to be selective in determining which approaches and actions make the most sense in their particular context. Key points in Stakeholder Engagement \u00b6 Build Rapport \u00b6 Relationship building takes time and so does gaining trust in a community. Following friendly visits to relevant stakeholders,with official introductions can help the Implementing agency build relationships based on trust and mutual respect and understanding. The initial field visits should mainly be for information gathering purposes. The visiting agents can assess culture, business activities, climatic conditions etc. This is usually best done with the help of a community leader or CAV champion. By building strong rapport with them in the beginning and engaging them in the project design, they will feel ownership of the project and that their views are important. Engagement needs to happen at the preparedness phase Taking a proactive approach means fighting the instinct to delay consultation because it is still early days and you don\u2019t have all the answers yet or are worried about raising expectations. The reality, most likely, is that people\u2019s expectations are already raised in some form or other, and that speculation about the project and the Implementing agency is beginning to circulate. Early engagement provides a valuable opportunity to influence public perception and set a positive tone with stakeholders early on. Be clear upfront that there are still many uncertainties and unknowns, and use early interactions with stakeholders as a predictor of potential issues and risks, and to help generate ideas and alternative solutions on early design questions. Don\u2019t wait until there is a problem to engage. In the high-pressure context of getting a project up and running, interacting with stakeholders when there doesn\u2019t seem to be any urgent need to do so can be viewed as a low priority and not a particularly good use of scarce time and resources. However, if a conflict or crisis does arise, the absence of established relationships and channels of communication puts the project at an immediate disadvantage in trying to manage the situation. First, communities and their representatives are much less likely to give an Implementing Agency they don\u2019t know (and have not had regular contact with) the benefit of the doubt. Second, trying to initiate contact with affected stakeholders when the agency is in a reactive, defensive or crisis management mode is less than ideal, and can create lasting negative perceptions that are difficult for the agency to later overcome. Furthermore, reaching out to third parties such as local government officials or NGOs for assistance as allies or intermediaries only after a problem occurs may be more difficult due to perceived reputational risks of being associated with the agency. Engaging with stakeholders from the start \u2013 as part of your core strategy \u2013 enables a proactive cultivation of relationships that can serve as \u201ccapital\u201d during challenging times. Begin with the end in mind \u00b6 Establishing and maintaining good relationships requires a long time-horizon. Implementing agencies who take this view tend to make different types of decisions. They invest in hiring and training community liaison staff and see the value of consistently following through on their commitments to stakeholders. They invest in translating information about their project into local languages and dialects and formats that make sense to the local population and do so on an ongoing basis. They make the effort to personalize relationships through informal and social interactions, and work through their employees to build links to local communities. They take grievances seriously and deal with them in a reliable and timely manner. They listen more and learn from the community. Their senior managers stay involved with stakeholder activities and integrate this function into their Implementation plans. Importantly, Implementing agencies that focus on lasting relationships think in terms of the bigger picture and do not allow short-term interests (such as negotiating the lowest possible compensation rates) to jeopardize their broader social license to operate in the area. At every stage of the implementation process, the end must be in our periphery. The aim of the CAVs is to have little to no external interference. Our goal is to ensure that the communities in the end do not need us at all. Having a clear exit strategy mapped out in the beginning will ensure that capacity building is taking place to enable and empower the community to thrive independently. Community Owned Programming \u00b6 Implementing agencies need to be prepared for the fact that they are entering into a pre-existing yet dynamic context, with established histories and cultures, and often complex political, social, and economic relations between groups that can be thrown into flux by the advent of a project and the development process that accompanies it. In other words, stakeholder relations can become politicized and complicated, and can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and other unanticipated outcomes. There is no easy formula for addressing these challenges, except to try to manage the process proactively and by adapting some of the established good practice approaches and principles described in this handbook to fit your own local context. By having relationships with local leaders, agencies can have a guide to the local cultures, politics, religion and customs and can ensure that the program is respectful and sensitive to it. Part One: Principles in Stakeholder Engagement \u00b6 This section presents a series of definitions, concepts and good practice principles for stakeholder engagement that are generally applicable across the range of project activities. Later, Part Two takes a closer look at how these specific practices and approaches may be most helpful during different phases of a project. Who are stakeholders? \u00b6 Stakeholders are persons or groups who are directly or indirectly affected by a project, as well as those who may have interests in a project and/or the ability to influence its outcome, either positively or negatively. Stakeholders may include locally affected communities or individuals and their formal and informal representatives, national or local government authorities, politicians, religious leaders, civil society organizations and groups with special interests, the academic community, or other businesses. The \u201cstake\u201d that each of these different individuals or groups has in a project or investment will vary. There are those with great influence over the project and others active in the local community. There are also stakeholders who, because of their knowledge or stature, can contribute positively to the project, for example, by acting as mediator when disputes arise. Effective Stakeholder Engagement \u00b6 Stakeholder engagement encompasses a range of activities and processes that the Implementing Agency must participate in for the term of the project. They can be divided into the 8 steps shown below Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Information Disclosure Stakeholder Consultation Negotiation and Partnerships Grievance Management Stakeholder Involvement in Project Monitoring Reporting to Stakeholders Management Functions 1.Stakeholder Identification and Analysis \u00b6 Ensure that the right stakeholders are engaged in the project design process and that their concerns, contributions and questions are addressed effectively. Their needs should be identified and analyzed so as to have them onboard with the intervention. 2. Information Disclosure \u00b6 Communicate information to stakeholders in ways that are meaningful and accessible in the early stages of the decision making process. Stakeholders should have privy to information about the implementation, timeline, performance etc. This communication process should continue throughout the project life cycle. Good practice involves taking steps to increase transparency and accountability as a means of promoting understanding about your project and engendering public trust. 3. Stakeholder Consultation \u00b6 Invest time in identifying and prioritizing stakeholders and assessing their needs and concerns. This should happen at the grassroots level and should be an inclusive process (PWDs, women and other marginalized stakeholders) 4. Negotiation and Partnerships \u00b6 For controversial issues, enter into amicable negotiations that satisfy the interest of all parties. Add value to impact mitigation or project benefits by forming strategic partnerships. These can be formed with local businesses or vendors or local governmental bodies e.g. local flour mill 5. Grievance Management \u00b6 Create safe and accessible mechanisms to enable complaint management throughout the project lifecycle. The use of local mediators e.g. local chiefs for conflict resolution is also a plus. 6. Stakeholder involvement in Project Monitoring \u00b6 By ensuring the above mechanisms are secure and effective, the community will be able to actively participate in project monitoring and management, giving them a sense of ownership to the intervention. 7. Reporting to stakeholders \u00b6 Report meaningful information back to the stakeholders on environmental, social and economic performance. This can be done through reports, pictures, videos and articles presented to relevant stakeholders. Not only will this show them the direct impact, it will also make them feel like a relevant part of the project. 8. Management Functions \u00b6 Build and maintain sufficient capacity in the Implementing agency to manage processes of stakeholder engagement, track commitments and deliver reports. Part Two: Best Practices and Approaches \u00b6 This part will dive into the industry best standards based on evidence. Program Design \u00b6 The key to this stage is early engagement and risk identification. Consultation with stakeholders at the program design stage should therefore be highly selective and targeted.Engaging stakeholder groups early in relation to these strategic decisions and alternatives can help to avoid project opposition and other reputational risks, expensive re-design, and compensation payments. It can also increase the chances that local stakeholders will align with you around the value proposition of the project. Moreover, early engagement may provide valuable opportunities to align the employment, training, infrastructure, and service demands of the project with the related plans and priorities of government agencies and local communities. BEST PRACTICES Refer to any past stakeholder information and consultation. Disclose and consult selectively in the very early stages. Disclose information on alternatives and design or location options. Where possible, engage with government during strategic planning. Review adequacy of any existing grievance procedures. Review potential legal, regulatory, and lender requirements for stakeholder engagement. Ensure that any project risk analysis includes stakeholder issues. For complex projects, consider forming a stakeholders\u2019 planning forum. Feasibility studies \u00b6 The most intense period of planned stakeholder engagement will likely take place during the project feasibility studies.The essential elements of stakeholder engagement at the time of project feasibility are: \u2022 Forward planning the engagement as one would any complex activity, with a schedule and sufficient staff with the right capabilities \u2022 Focusing principal efforts on those stakeholders most affected by the project, whether because of proximity or vulnerability to change \u2022 Demonstrating that people\u2019s opinions and ideas are receiving serious consideration, whether by \u201cdesigning-out\u201d identified risks, \u201cdesigning-in\u201d additional local economic or social benefits, or incorporating the views of stakeholders in testing the feasibility of various design and risk management options BEST PRACTICES Systematically identify project stakeholders and their interests \\ Review regulatory and financing requirements for stakeholder engagement on projects. Involve stakeholders in the \u201cscoping\u201d phase of feasibility studies. Seek input from stakeholders on how they wish to be consulted. Prepare a stakeholder engagement plan commensurate with project impacts. Provide information ahead of consultations on environmental and social impacts. Use consultation to enhance mitigation and agree compensation and benefits. Maintain involvement with government-led consultation. Gauge the level of stakeholder support for your project. Facilitate access to community liaison staff. Report changes in the evolving project design to stakeholders on a regular basis. Document the process and results of consultation. Operations \u00b6 Engagement with external stakeholders should be considered an integral component of operations management, whether this be day-to-day operational activities, periodic programs, or in emergency situations. Depending on the nature and scale of the project, stakeholder engagement may be relevant to the performance of a range of departments and functions within the company and should be integrated into existing systems, including health and safety, environmental management, procurement and contractor management, logistics management, site or plant inspections and audits, external communications, security considerations, and project risk management. BEST PRACTICES Periodically review and update your stakeholder information. Consider ways to assess stakeholder perceptions. Continue to disclose, consult, and report to stakeholders as needed. Ensure integration of ongoing stakeholder commitments into operations management systems. Communicate emergency preparedness and response plans on a regular basis. Keep your grievance mechanism operational. Consider establishing a participatory or third-party monitoring program. For controversial projects, consider establishing an independent monitoring panel. Example Stakeholder List \u00b6 Before research in the community can be carried out, there is an essential need to engage the local government and essential stakeholders in the discussion about CAVs. In the example of Kenya, a village chief and DCC must always be alerted during the initial phase of Implementation.This is to be done before any community engagement can take place. This is to protect the community from fraudsters and ensure due diligence is done to protect the beneficiaries. Note that having a local Trainer of Trainers on board that knows the relevant authorities, customs and languages is wonderful to work with and assist in any meetings. A brief introduction is given to relevant persons after an official letter is sent out to their offices asking for an audience (see below). This list below are people who should be engaged during the preparedness phase, communities respond better to new interventions when the following people are on board: Village chief Village administrators Village Elders District County Commissioner Local religious leaders Community leaders Area MPs Governors Local businesses owners Local Industries Local Trade unions Suppliers and vendors Other Humanitarian Organizations County Government Chairpersons of local community groups Local activists Civil society groups Community Based Organizations Faith Based Organizations Women\u2019s Representative Vulnerable groups in the community should be identified with the help of local stakeholders. This group is necessary for CVA and other humanitarian programs. Sample letter to local government stakeholder \u00b6 From: Official Implementer Address To: Local Government Office Position, Location DD-MM-YYYY Dear Sir/ Madam, Re: Community Asset Vouchers This Implementing Agency, with the assistance of county governments and other local stakeholders such as, Mosques, Churches, community chamas, schools, and individuals alike are working to create healthy and sustainable communities in the face of hard economic conditions. Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) can be described as vouchers created by local groups and organizations that can be used to support vulnerable households in communities. During times of crisis it helps communities support each other and maintain continued trade regardless of whether or not an individual can access local currency. In general, the CAV program aims to empower communities to take on the responsibility for their own financial well-being and economic growth. The purpose of the training is to help communities understand the benefits and obligations of being part of the network. For instance, Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) are a means to launch community projects, jump-start or bolster local economies, boost financial inclusion and to foster independence and sustainability of vulnerable communities. CAVs are easy to use and open to everyone as a means of offering their support to the local community by providing their goods and services for barter trade. To enroll you simply dial 384 96# on your phone line. [Or other instructions] It is in this regard that we write to your esteemed office requesting for a time to meet and ultimately authorization to continue with the implementation of Community Asset Vouchers within District and its environs. Thank you and we look forward to your support.

Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) can be described as vouchers created by local groups and organizations that can be used to support vulnerable households in communities. During times of crisis it helps communities support each other and maintain continued trade regardless of whether or not an individual can access local currency. In general, the CAV program aims to empower communities to take on the responsibility for their own financial well-being and economic growth. The purpose of the training is to help communities understand the benefits and obligations of being part of the network. For instance, Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) are a means to launch community projects, jump-start or bolster local economies, boost financial inclusion and to foster independence and sustainability of vulnerable communities. CAVs are easy to use and open to everyone as a means of offering their support to the local community by providing their goods and services for barter trade. To enroll you simply dial 384 96# on your phone line. [Or other instructions] It is in this regard that we write to your esteemed office requesting for a time to meet and ultimately authorization to continue with the implementation of Community Asset Vouchers within District and its environs.

It is an effective way to support people affected by emergencies while maintaining their dignity and promoting local economies. Over time, technology has transformed the cash assistance from manual remittance to digital processes such as mobile money and distributed ledger technology. One such innovation is the usage of Community Asset Vouchers (CAV), which enables communities to issue and trade vouchers among themselves and for humanitarian organisations to use these vouchers to support those in need. There is often a lack of a medium of exchange to connect a community\u2019s underutilised resources to local demand This is the core of Community Asset Vouchers: to provide a replicable economic, technical and social mechanism that enables communities to increase local trade. Specifically CAVs offer a way to develop local vouchers which can be used for CVA programs. \\ \\ This Programme Quality Toolkit is developed to offer practical guidance and tools on how to implement a CAV project covering all phases of the project cycle: Preparedness, \\ Assessment, \\ Response analysis, \\ Set-up and implementation, and \\ Monitoring and Evaluation. It outlines the steps for human and infrastructure resources required to support communities to implement their own Community Asset Voucher. It is directed towards field staff and volunteers but also for everyone who should have interest in knowing more on CAV. It is thought of as a supplement to the existing CVA tools and guidelines. How to use the Programme Quality Toolkit \u00b6 This PQT can be used in all response phases; in preparedness working with risk forecasting systems, in emergency responses, in early recovery, and development settings to increase the resilience of a community. What the Toolkit is The PQT is intended to guide the entire end-to-end process of establishing and managing a Community Asset Voucher project (CAV). It outlines the project cycle phases, provides tools and key considerations for each phase as well as highlights potential challenges that were drawn from pilot projects in Kenya. The implementing organisation can use the PQT alongside their programme design documents to enrich and ensure better quality in their planning and implementation by ensuring all important actions are taken at each phase of the project cycle. The PQT also includes a module on monitoring and evaluation, providing resources for the user to undertake appropriate learning with regards to their implementation, thus ensuring iteration and improvement of the programme implementation. What the Toolkit is not The Toolkit is intended as a high-level guidance that organisations implementing CAVs can use to develop and refine their own implementation approaches. It is not a blueprint for all CAV projects as it is developed based primarily on observations and lessons learnt from a CAV project (layered onto CVA programs) in Kenya. As such, due to variations in context, we recommend that the ToolKit is viewed in this light and the guidance herein adapted to the relevant context based on the expertise and experiences of the implementing organisation. There are several ways of making use of this Toolkit. As it is built up around all the phases of the project cycle, each section is divided into steps and substeps, which are indicative and not strictly sequential. The PQT will outline minimum requirements for each module to ensure programme fidelity for essential steps. Users of the PQT can: Follow each phase of the project cycle from preparedness all the way to monitoring and analysis, Skip some of the phases and go straight to the ones you would like to know more about, Use the relevant tools and guidance documents shared in specific sections for their everyday work Find other resources and tools in the Appendix Audience of PQT \u00b6 While the PQT can be used by everyone who is interested in or working with CAV programs. It is specifically targeted toward Implementers who are seeing to support vulnerable communities to issue and maintain a CAV and dig deeper into innovative ways of doing CVA \\ The specific audiences of the PQT include: Humanitarian organisations Innovation and innovation leading institutions The general audience of the PQT include: Social enterprises Village saving and loan associations (VSLA) Non-movement organisations Microfinance institution Technology solution providers E-payment solution providers Government financial institutions Community-based organisations Government agencies The development of the Programme Quality Toolkit \u00b6 The PQT was designed based on experience from CAV pilot projects implemented by Grassroots Economics Foundation and the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). Specific learning includes Kenyan programs in Mukuru and Kisauni peri-urban areas in Nairobi and Mombasa respectively. In Kisauni, the project was a 10 months early recovery project in response to the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19. In Mukuru, the project was a development project. The development process entailed reviewing existing literature on CAVs and conducting interviews with the key implementing organisations (KRCS, Danish Red Cross and Grassroot Economics Foundation) as well as with project beneficiaries in Mukuru and Kisauni. Additional input to the development of the PQT included project visits, observations, participation in several project meetings as well as a continuous collaboration with all partners involved. Users of the tool can share suggestions for improving this tool with the maintainers, which will inform periodic reviews based on real-world experiences. Reference material used to update the PQT can include publications, guidance documents, literature and other programmatic documents that are developed by organisations working in the sector. The maintainers may also convene consultative processes and workshops to further develop and explore inputs for consideration. Overview of the PQT \u00b6 The PQT is organised into modules that correspond to a normal project cycle as summarised in the logical framework . These are: Introduction to CAVs This module seeks to give an overall understanding of what a CAV is. It outlines a case study as well as legal frameworks as well as Core Service Providers (such as technical infrastructure). Preparedness Implementing organisations and partners fully understands and are prepared to implement a CAV program: This module outlines the steps to prepare for implementation of a CAV project, in the different response phases. Vouchers / Ledger system and microservices in place: It highlights the technical and organisational prerequisites for the implementing organisations to undertake a CAV project, for example any institutional arrangements in the event of partnerships between several organisations as well as providing guidance on how an implementing organisation can develop a preliminary understanding of the context. Situation Analysis and Stakeholder Engagement This module outlines the steps required to understand the context in depth through conducting assessment of the households to identify their needs as well as their access to markets. Stakeholders Identification and introduction: An essential step in the success of CAV creation and implementation. This module and accompanying guidebook aims to help Implementing Agencies understand the importance of Stakeholder engagement in all phases of the project. The successful exit strategy from the community depends on a successful stakeholder engagement strategy. Joint Implementation Plan: This module outlines the steps for identifying the beneficiaries and supporting to implement and maintain their CAV, as well as developing strategies to mediate conflicts borne out of CAV use. Screening and baselines: Provide a way to choose successful community groups to issue CAVs and start measuring for impacts. Localization of Materials and CAV/Voucher systems: Effective onboarding of communities will be made easier when information is translated and localised to the community. This module helps with promoting ownership of the intervention in the community. Implementation Community Sensitization: This module outlines the steps for implementing CAVs with resources for identifying and registering beneficiaries, guides for communicating and engaging with the community. Capacity Development & Cash and Voucher Assistance: This module suggests methods for interacting with CAV Issuing Groups and their surrounding communities through Capacity Building and Cash and Voucher Assistance. Community Mobilisation: Spreading a CAV program from the issuers to the larger communities and connecting with other CAVs into regional markets. Monitoring and evaluation This module provides guidance to the implementation team to develop and deploy timely assessments, to understand whether the CAV project is meeting the policy goals (e.g. support a community response to a disaster, improve local productivity by spurring trade etc.) thus providing insights for both strategic and operational goals to guide decision-making. The M&E section is intended to: support programme implementation to inform decision-making on improving performance; contribute to organisational learning and knowledge sharing; uphold accountability and compliance; as well as provide a platform for collating stakeholder feedback. INTRODUCTION TO CAVs \u00b6 About CAVs \u00b6 This module seeks to give an overall understanding of what CAVs are. It outlines a case study as well as legal frameworks and Core Service Providers (such as technical infrastructure). Case Study - Binguni & Mbele in Kenya \u00b6 Read the case study here: case_study PREPAREDNESS \u00b6 Organisational preparedness \u00b6 This section outlines the steps for documenting the operational readiness, capacity and gaps in implementing CAVs. The starting point is to understand the level of preparedness for CAV implementation. A comprehensive landscape review and analysis of secondary data to understand the full scope of the response and recovery context for the specific region within a country the users/implementing organisations are operating in. The team should focus on several aspects: history of crises, recovery efforts, community vulnerabilities, government and non-governmental programmes and policies, the legal framework including privacy and data protection issues, coordination mechanisms for responding to crisis or for providing humanitarian assistance, market capacity and dynamics; and level of infrastructure and services. The data can be gathered from government sources for example from publications from national and local governments that include legislations, budgets, relevant policies and strategic plans, standard operating procedures , guidelines and other published literature by development and humanitarian agencies working in the relevant sector. It is essential to understand the level of financial and economic literacy among beneficiaries. This can be done by carrying out surveys (See sample in Appendix) that gauge the communities readiness. These surveys can also be used to identify important information that is necessary for evidence based studies such as RCTs. Volunteers can be trained on conducting the surveys, and on the Data Privacy and Protection policy and procedures (See Appendix) that must be adhered to. Primary data collection and analysis: After the landscape review, the implementing organisation will conduct a workshop with internal stakeholders from the relevant departments (Disaster Management, Finance, Logistics, Innovation Development, etc.) to carry out a self-assessment on the capacity of their organisation to implement a CAV project as they would any CVA program. As such, the process of understanding the preparedness of the organisation will include the following steps: The self-assessment process Main activities Assemble key stakeholders Identify a group of technical, management and support functions Schedule and plan for workshop Secure key stakeholders to participate in the workshop Ensure the workshop facilitator is someone with CAV expertise Conduct workshop Discuss and gain consensus on the assessment scores Graph and present back the assessment scores to the group Propose a range of activities to help strengthen their CAV capacity based on the assessment outcomes Develop Plan of Action (PoA) Prioritise and detail the actions Present the draft PoA to National Society\u2019s leadership for approval Follow-through with PoA by implementing the PoA, incorporating it into internal plans, using it for a funding proposal, etc. Within the workshop, the participants will rank their organisations preparedness across four main thematic areas, namely: Enabling systems Programme tools Resources and capacity Communication and coordination Self assessment checklist for the CAV Implementing Organisation \u00b6 Do we have the needed staff or Volunteers to support the field operations? Training, Capacity Building, M&E, Administration .. etc. The composition of the project implementation team should be drawn from the internal departments that were part of the workshop to reflect the entire scope of functions and competencies required for successful implementation of the CAV project. The implementing organisation should build the capacity of the team based on their role in the CAV project and any identified gaps to ensure that the team is equipped to undertake the project. Are we prepared to be a Core Service Provider long term? (User support, server maintenance, last-mile services) If not, do we have service agreements with one to support technical services? Have we entered into a legal framework where our organisation can hold CAVs? How will CAVs be held (wallets, multisig) and what procedures will we adopt for their usage? Are we compliant with local laws regarding holding and trading Vouchers? Are we sure any user data we hold is being stored securely and compliant with international standards? Will we be able to bring onboard needed stakeholders? - Such as local faith based organisations, administrations, businesses, etc. Are the groups we are targeting to help develop a CAV prepared? Will those CAV Issuing Groups be able to provide enough services and redeemable CAV (vouchers) to our target beneficiaries? If not can we build their capacity through additional training, assets and income generating activities that their CAV can be reliably redeemed for? Programmatic preparedness \u00b6 Legal Framework \u00b6 This legal design for a Fiscal Commons utilises the Nondominium framework developed by Chris Cook, where mutually defined Instruments (such as Vouchers/CAVs) are utilised by (General Members) who jointly oversee active stewards (Service Providers) subject to passive custodians (Guardians) with protective governance rights of arbitration and final veto. By developing an inclusive legal Nondominium framework for CAVs an open community is created that anyone can opt into and as long as the protocols are followed they can develop member to member agreements which decentralise the commons and maintain integrity. The agreements Fiscal Commons can be broken into various agreements: Clearing Union (CU): A general overarching agreement that defines a fiscal commons Core Service Provider (CSP) Agreement: CSPs provide training, mediation, and run various micro-services, like ledger systems, wallets and marketplaces. General Member: Community Groups, organisations and individuals using Vouchers or other CU defined Instruments are considered General Members Intermember Services: Establishes agreements between General Members and Service Providers Feasibility study \u00b6 The major objectives of conducting the feasibility study will be: To understand the general CVA landscape in the target country/region To validate the needs of the communities To analyse the markets to know their functionality and ability of CAVs to increase local trade, and the supply chains for the market To assess viability of delivery mechanisms for digital vouchers To understand political and community acceptance for the CAVs The feasibility study will be conducted using a combination of approaches. A way of gathering this information is by conducting key informant interviews with local authorities and players in the market as well as hold focus group discussion with community members to gauge understanding and acceptability of CAVs. The team should finally hold meetings with selected key stakeholders who implement assistance programs and other humanitarian initiatives to better understand the complexity and challenges of implementation in the locality. Finally, the team should conduct physical visits to the markets in the local communities to document the variety of goods and services that would be potential targets for CAV transactions. Conduct Benefit and Risk Analysis \u00b6 This section outlines the steps in identifying the risks of implementing CAVs programmes, ranking the risks in order of gravity and defining the mitigation measures which should directly relate to the cause of the risk, for those risks. In this section, risks identified across each of the categories should be listed and clearly described, which will include their causes and potential effects on the implementation of a CAV project. In addition, where the project is integrated with other humanitarian programs, the risks of this integration should be described and addressed), separately from the risks of implementing the CBP, which should be analysed separately. Risk management checklist: Social Risk: Once CAV is introduced, is the implementer ready to purchase all the CAV created by a community as an exit strategy? Technical Risk: Should core services fail are there ways for people to access their balances? Are backups of accounts being kept? Regulatory Risk: Is there a risk that the Government will change national legislation about digital assets like vouchers? Political Risk: Are local governments and national governments endorsing CAV creation and usage long term? Exit Strategy: What happens to the record of everyone\u2019s CAV accounts if the system is ever shut down? Can the CAV continue operation once there is no more support? Once the risks have been identified using the above checklist, they should be ranked based on likelihood of occurrence and impact (consequences) on programming once they occur. This ranking can be done using the risk matrix in the appendix. All risks, regardless of their likelihood or impact, should be monitored and addressed during the project cycle, especially where there is potential for risks to increase or decrease during the project. Multiple mitigation strategies can be adopted for each risk, where necessary. Map existing social protection programmes that can be linked to CAVs including assessing readiness and point for convergence. Mapping ongoing assistance programs can help avoid unintentional duplication of work by different agencies and support better integration of CAVs with other assistance programs where this is the appropriate design. Additionally, by highlighting response gaps, it can help in the development of appropriate assistance programmes and provide options for sustainability of CAVs after the exit of the primary implementing organisations by embedding the same within the humanitarian assistance ecosystem. * Mapping assistance programs The following are a list of possible programs that can integrate well into CAV. Income generation Livelihoods Training Cash Transfer Programs * Stakeholder mapping and engagement In addition to mapping the assistance programs, the implementation team should also map the relevant stakeholders who are working at both the national and local level and that may have an influence in the outcome of the project. This will range from relevant government institutions, peer organisations working on CAVs and other community assistance programs, other partners working on other recovery efforts among others. The Stakeholder engagement guide in the appendix provides a template for systematic identification, analysis of influence and development of an engagement strategy (method, channel and frequency). Partnership\u2019s preparedness In some instances, the implementation of CAV projects may involve more than one organisation performing different roles in the project. One way of implementation may entail a humanitarian organisation with community networks that are partnering with an institution that operates and manages the technology anchoring the digital vouchers of the CAV. If the ideal long-term strategy is to transition the technology to the implementing organisation, structures coordinating mechanisms must be established for seamless implementation of the project. Such a collaboration is best guided by a partnership framework with Core Service Providers that outlines key roles and responsibilities, establishes how the partnership and the activities therein will be coordinated including articulating clear communication channels,timelines, financial responsibilities and dispute resolution among other pertinent arrangements (e.g. exit planning). In addition, the partnership should assess the capacity of the payment service provider (similar to the assessment for CAV preparedness) to understand: Services provided and linkages with other relevant technology for instance, whether there will be interlinkage with other CAVs, and how the CAVs will be accessed by users Costs related to operating the CAV technology, institution responsible for those costs, including the costs to the user of CAV Infrastructure requirements including whether the organisation is compliant with data protection laws that may be in place in the country Human resource capacity and requirements, including customer support/complaints handling capacity and whether the capacity is sufficient to support the project Technological preparedness \u00b6 Technology Setup \u00b6 Generally the technical setup is done by a local Core Service Provider like Grassroots Economics (The more local the better.) Open Source (CopyLeft) Software: Ensure that you trust the software being used and that even if it is open source now, that improvements and upgrades will remain open source. Check out the software stack . Distributed Ledger: We highly recommend developing your own ledger system where members of the community hold nodes that decentralise and secure the ledger. Interfaces / Wallets: We\u2019ve built custodial systems that enable users to assign guardians that can help them reset lost passwords. Data Sharing: Given the consent of the community, anonymous transaction data can be recorded and displayed The implementing organisation further needs to carry out an assessment of the technological landscape to ensure the requisite infrastructure to support a CAV is available. First, an understanding of the context of the community is important to determine the type of mobile phones being used, including whether the phones are internet ready, internet penetration in the area, and familiarity with mobile money transactions. This will determine whether the primary interaction with the CAV network will be through USSD or web/native mobile applications or through paper vouchers. Assessment checklist for Core Service Providers The following Core Services are provided for sustainably through and after the end of the project: Digital account access and security (Ledger services and interfaces) Support and mediation The Core Service Provider\u2019s services handle the project's influx of new users There is no lock-in legally or technically to particular CSPs. Ledger services, such as node operation are well secured and decentralised to ensure that the ledger will remain active indefinitely and usable with any number of CSPs. All technical infrastructure software is utilising open source, AGPL 3.0 CopyLeft or equivalent licences to ensure that the software and it\u2019s modifications and derivatives will always remain open source. Data is being stored with local and international data protection policies in place. Ledger and other micro-services are offered by the CSP with simple service fees (without volatility). The ledger technology, web/mobile applications are developed and have a dedicated team of software developers/engineers to implement and subsequently manage the technology that underpins the CAV. Fees are guaranteed to remain as cheap as possible and/or zero rated for vulnerable communities - The CSP should ideally be a non-profit institution to uphold this requirement of maintaining public infrastructure indefinitely without excess rent seeking. There are clear arrangements for which party bears the transaction costs for servicer or services costs in providing the technical infrastructure. Accessibility to the system is provided to people who can\u2019t access the internet or phones. Project documentation is further availed on publicly-available repositories. Legal service agreements are signed for CSPs as part of a Clearing Union SITUATION ANALYSIS & STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT \u00b6 Needs assessment \u00b6 A needs assessment is a process that will support the CAV implementation team to better understand the community which is being targeted for CAV. Specifically, the assessment will highlight the goods and services that are needed by targeted households, the scale and duration for which these goods are required and the present and anticipated barriers to accessing the same. This assessment will further augment the feasibility study by providing information on whether the community will be able to meet the needs through local production and what role CAVs will play in facilitating access and bridging any identified gaps to meeting the identified needs. The findings of the assessment are critical to the subsequent program design as it will guide the process of generating CAVs as well as determine the value and amount of the CAVs as well as who should receive the CAVs._ _ Objectives and scope of the needs assessment includes: The basic needs to be assessed Geographical areas of interest Affected groups of interest Decisions to be informed To conduct the needs assessment, the implementation team will carry out the following activities: Design and planning for needs assessment. This is a critical step where the implementation team identifies the objectives of the assessment and outlines how these will be met, which will include identifying key activities, stakeholders and resources that will be required. Data collection and analysis Secondary data collection Secondary data will provide the baseline information about the target communities, their priority needs and vulnerabilities and for CAV recovery projects, identifying the impact of socioeconomic shocks on the community (which can be differentiated from systemic/ongoing issues). Based on this information, the implementation team will determine data gaps that require primary data collection. Primary data collection Primary data collection is collected mainly through household interviews and focus group discussion in the target communities. The key steps that the implementation team should undertake are: Seeking requisite approvals : The implementation team should obtain the required approvals, including ethical clearance where necessary, to conduct primary data collection in the community based on the standards and practises of the country of interest. Conducting field work : Design of assessment protocol. A robust data collection protocol to ensure the data collected is valid and representative of the target community is essential. Key features of the data collection protocol include: selection of study sites, application of appropriate sampling strategies, clear identification of objectives, research questions and analytical approach as well as an exploration of ethical considerations. Data collection through household interviews and focus group discussions as has been outlined in the assessment protocol. Further information can be obtained from GEs internal Data protection and sensitivity policy and procedure document, found in the appendix. Analyse collected data to provide information about the community\u2019s needs, barriers to access and preferences of the community for different assistance programmes to mitigate the barriers. Key indicators from the data analysis include: Demographic and socio-economic profile Typical basket of goods and services needed by the community (and their sources within the community) Barriers to access to the prioritised goods and services (ranked by frequency of standard list of barriers such as finances, physical access, reliability etc.) Minimum expenditure basket One of the key objectives of the assessment is to identify the key priority needs of the target population and translate the same into a typical expenditure basket \u2013 food and/or non-food items, and basic and/or livelihoods expenditure, depending on the objective of the response. The implementation team should refer to both primary data collected from the field (e.g., through focus group discussions with community members stratified by income category) as well as secondary data to determine which items should be included in the minimum expenditure basket (MEB). The prioritised basket can then be quantified into local prices which will then inform the process of CAV creation at community level to determine the value and amount of CAVs to be generated and distributed to participants. In the context of CAVs, MEB analysis can provide a basis of determination of the value (pegged to the local currency) and the amount of digital vouchers that will be generated and airdropped in the target community. Where CAVs are implemented alongside other cash assistance programmes, the implementation team should model the proportion of transactions that would be ideal for each type of assistance based on project objectives which include access to services and promoting local trade. For instance, in a context where there is limited local production, or the crisis has severely affected the same necessitating external supplies, a higher proportion of cash assistance can be provided initially to aid in recovery with CAVs introduced in phases once local production has increased. 1. **Resource Mapping** The CAV implementation team carries out resource mapping to gain an understanding of producers and consumers and the productive capacity of goods and services within the CAV target community as well as the supply chain within and into the community. This will highlight whether the challenges in the market are supply side (scarcity) or demand side (lack of money or accessibility) through answering two key questions: Are there goods and services within the community that the potential CAV participants need? Can the market respond to changes in demand occasioned by introduction and use of CAVs by the community? Understanding the capacity of the market to meet demand and any access barriers will influence programme design by informing how the CAV will work for traders, service providers and other community members and whether there will be an effect on the prices for both CAV users and other members of the community. Key areas that the market assessment will evaluate include whether there is: A functioning market, where the potential CAV members can trade their goods and services Capacity for local production Knowledge gaps that can be easily filled through trainings Source of goods routinely traded in the market including clear supply and resupply modalities Availability of traders that can exchange with each other and have the capacity to produce goods locally. Price stability, including seasonal effects Geographical accessibility of shops/markets to targeted CAV participants Taxation regime in place and its impact on final prices of goods and services Mobile and internet availability to facilitate transactions across targeted CAV participants Needs and market assessment should be conducted routinely throughout the project lifecycle. The implementation team should incorporate aspects of these assessment in routine M&E activities to have a continuous understanding how introduction of CAV has affected the needs as well as monitor prices and uptake of select goods and services to understand whether CAVs have had a negative impact on the same through price distortions or inflation. For a digital CAV a CSP will provide anonymous transactional data updated regularly that show how the CAV is circulating or stagnating. This transaction data is crucial for understanding the success of the project. Assessment checklist for CAV Issuing Groups \u00b6 Does the group trade among yourselves already in national currency or in-kind? Does the group participate in some form of collective accounting (e.g. table banking)? Does the group have regular meetings (e.g. weekly)? Does the group offer valuable goods and or services already? Do they have clear membership rules and mediation? Has the group been active for more than 6 months? Are the CAV (Voucher) creation rules clear? 10% of the sum of all the goods and services that the group members offers per year Commitments to redeem vouchers issued by group members must be audited by local authorities and in the form of a legal contract. Does the 2% monthly levy on CAV balances going back to a group wallet have a clear purpose? Does the amount of vouchers that this group can create and redeem represent a meaningful amount for the program? If not, does the group need further capacity building? Legal membership agreements should be signed by the group as part of a Clearing Union Targeting \u00b6 Since the majority of the interventions will be done in the informal context through the use of community groups, a selection mechanism should be in place to serve as a checklist or framework for how to choose which groups to work with. Below is a scenario to illustrate why this is necessary. Scenario Example A village savings group in a community where the intervention is taking place has approached the Volunteers in a bid to implement CAVs. Volunteers train the group and the group is enabled to create their own CAV redeemable for their own goods and services. The group also begins to trade this CAV with people outside their group. After months of trading, the Implementing organisation receives a call from a Volunteer alerting them on the gamification taking place in the savings group. The members are simply trading back and forth to show they are using it but aren\u2019t exchanging goods and services. Also CAV holders outside the group that have accepted it find they can\u2019t redeem it for anything from the group. The group in question didn\u2019t really have goods or services to offer, nor did they have table banking procedures or even weekly contributions or meetings. The process of targeting should be participatory and collaborative, involving various stakeholders working on humanitarian and other assistance programs to allow for transparency, build the trust of the community and avoid duplication of efforts and assistance, which may negate the intention of CAVs. As a corollary to this collaborative approach, the implementation team should initiate and maintain clear communication throughout the project implementation to pre-empt any misunderstanding around why some groups/households are included in the project and others are not, thus reducing the risk of hostility or resistance of the project by non-participating community members. As such, the objectives of the project should be clearly articulated for both the stakeholders as well as the community. Additionally, the implementation team should develop, maintain and share with stakeholders (including local government officials) a list of clear (and ideally, replicable) criteria that it will use for targeting beneficiaries for the CAV project. The implementation team should also account for additional factors that will influence the targeting process, including: striking a balance between administrative ease and costs and the political acceptability within the community. Geographical targeting \u00b6 As highlighted in Module 3, CAVs are targeted in communities with an accessible market, with both vendors and consumers who have capacity to produce and participate in trade. Therefore, when targeting communities for a CAV project, proximity of the market(s) and other goods and services that will be traded using CAV to beneficiaries is a primary consideration, including ease of access to the identified market. The implementation team should identify the target community using through a series of (non-sequential) steps that may entail: review of secondary data, consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders, and analysis of market assessment data collected by the team, including analysis of administrative maps for an understanding of boundaries and settlement patterns. Identification of a singular community with clear delineation of boundaries in an urban setting may be especially challenging in informal settlements, where the populations are fluid and markets as well as other amenities and services are shared across areas. Subsequent beneficiary targeting will further strengthen the geographical targeting as community groups (see 4.1.2) are more likely to have close ties and frequent interactions that may transcend borders and alleviate these urban challenges. Beneficiary targeting \u00b6 CAVs should be implemented in communities with strong community groups, particularly those that are involved in some form of income generation, or informal financial/saving groups that bring together members to save and invest. Once geographical conditions have been met and the community with an accessible market is identified, the implementation team can begin the process of targeting community groups for participation in the CAV project. Targeting criteria \u00b6 A primary criterion for a CAV issuing community group should be membership in a community financial/savings group. However, an individual household can be included in the CAV project if they offer a particular good/service that is common to the minimum expenditure baskets of targeted community group members. As a start, the establishment of a broad criteria that can be adopted to various contexts can be considered. For instance, cut-off points can be established to help determine which households or groups will be included: e.g., households owning more than a set number of assets (livestock, household assets etc.) or households earning more than a certain income threshold per month. Transparency, stakeholder involvement and harmonisation with other assistance programmes \u00b6 CAVs can also be used as precursors to other assistance programmes, as it can provide data allowing other CVA projects to better target aid. When a CAV is complemented by another project, the objectives of the latter can be factored in when determining the overall criteria for targeting. For instance, where the aim of the assistance is to meet individual needs during an emergency, a less stringent criteria can be applied to target a wider proportion of the community, whereas in a recovery setting, targeting based on socio-economic, contextual and other factors will better enable the CAV and other CVAs to meet their objectives. IMPLEMENTATION \u00b6 Local Sensitization \u00b6 Trainers of Trainers (ToTs) \u00b6 Before engaging with local stakeholders or community groups it is important to work with ToTs. These may be field officers from the region, or volunteers that know the local context, customs and language. They are the best at approaching local community groups and local stakeholders. Sensitise Local Stakeholders \u00b6 Local leaders, faith based organisations, local administration and businesses as well as groups are important to sensitise before working with community groups. In preparation for the CAV creation process, the project team, together with the local authorities and other stakeholders should conduct a sensitization of the community ahead of the CAV creation process to create awareness of the activity and reduce any misunderstanding that may cause tension in the community. The team can leverage on established events such as community meetings and clearly communicate the objectives and target participants. The community entry should be conducted in two stages: first, with local community stakeholders on CiC and subsequently, through a community entry meeting with a broader community/community groups to introduce the concept, objectives and benefits of CAVs. The project team should coordinate with other stakeholders for a smooth rollout of the process to avoid scheduling conflicts and to promote optimal participation. Additionally, the team should liaise with local authorities, informing them of the program activity for a smooth community entry and assurance of the necessary security where needed. More on stakeholder engagement can be found in the Appendix. Voucher (CAV) Generation \u00b6 Once the participating community and CAV issuing groups have been identified, the implementation team should work with the target communities to do a full CAV training as detailed in the Case Study in part one. This will determine the number of Vouchers that the group should generate. This amount should account for both the minimum expenditure basket at household level as well as the volume of trade/transactions expected between community group members, while factoring in the overall objectives of the CAV project. To ensure liquidity, ability to restock as well as to meet the objective of boosting local trade, the value of vouchers should be pegged on the total production potential of the targeted groups. Ensure that a maximum of 12% of a group's committed annual sales capacity is used to guarantee redemptions for the created CAVs. This means that there is always more than enough goods and services in value compared to the vouchers issued (overcollateralization). Therefore, the community groups and other stakeholders will determine the supply of vouchers generated per group as above, how that amount varies within different groups within the community (based on their production capacity), and how the vouchers will be disbursed. Read more about the Voucher (CAV) Creation process: voucher creation steps Conflict resolution \u00b6 Critical to the success of a CAV project is the process through which disputes on value of vouchers, refusal of CAVs as medium of exchange between group members, and the process of members exiting a group. It is crucial that the design of the mechanism for resolving conflict is entrenched in existing platforms at community level to ensure acceptability by members and to foster sustainability beyond the lifespan of the project. The implementation team must proactively help community groups establish this mechanism so that members know of its existence and function and use it for the intended purpose. Additionally, since the mediators may not be part of the CAV project, the implementation team should conduct in-depth sensitization to ensure understanding of the project objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria and general functioning of the CAV as a medium of exchange. Community Mobilisation \u00b6 Note that without any intervention the CAVs created by the community will enter the larger population through trade. Freely offering the vouchers to the rest of the community who are not committed to redemption themselves would lead to the issuing group becoming insolvent. The CAVs, as vouchers with guaranteed redemption by the issuing group, should be used productively by the issuing group. They can be traded for labour, sold and so on. Should the issuing group decide to donate them to support elderly, they should be hailed as an example of a social enterprise. Each member of an issuing group should enrol 3 to 5 more people in the community to accept them as payment, while knowing they can be redeemed by the issuing group for goods and services (not national currency). CAV use \u00b6 As outlined in the previous module, the project implementation team will work with the community groups and other stakeholders to determine the supply of vouchers generated. Once the vouchers are generated, the community issuing groups should be notified of their allocations and how to transact using the vouchers amongst the group members and with other voucher recipients within their community. To stimulate circulation of CAVs within the community, the CAV design should disincentive hoarding through a demurrage (a reduction in value of the vouchers by a defined proportion if the CAV remains unused for a specified period). Users of CAVs should be well educated on the demurrage, which should be public and acceptable by the community. This further serves the objectives of the CAV project \u2013 to stimulate local trade by guaranteeing a certain level of transactions. * Capacity Development and Cash and Voucher Assistance Programs While so far this PQT has focused on helping communities develop CAVs, Humanitarian organisations also have several options for interacting with CAVs in order to support target populations for immediate relief and long term development: Capacity Building: When identifying resources that people have to share \u2013 gaps in those resources compared to need often arise. Filling these gaps through training and asset development can help the community have a solid framework for voucher redemption. They can invest in developing more income generating activities within the community. For example, they could buy a maize mill, or provide business training to the group members in order to improve their ability to generate income with their latent capacity. This can increase the amount of CAVs that the community can redeem and hence issue. Evidence based support: If there is sufficient capacity and enough CAVs, they can buy CAVs from the groups (as they would any Voucher), either from the communal pots or from the members themselves, and redistribute those vouchers out to the broader community as in a CVA program. They are effectively pre-buying the goods and services of the members within the group, and allowing for the broader community to have access to goods and services that they didn\u2019t have money for before. Rather than providing cash, which would quickly leave the community, the vouchers ensure a local circulation of currency, and a boost to local trade. Indexing: Data from CAV circulation and endorsements from validators is indexed based on Sustainable Development Goals and a rank and reward can be calculated for support Donor Support: Donors can be rewarded with SDG impact data in the form of a certificate they can also follow up on future impacts. Treasuries: Based on results from Indexing a Humanitarian organisation can choose to purchase vouchers with donor funds (held in Treasuries). Redistribution: Based on results from Indexing CAVs held in Treasuries can be redistributed directly to those people in need. This is similar to a Cash and Voucher Assistance program but with the vouchers coming from the local community. Providing aid in this way, to the communities, has allowed for higher volumes and more sustainable circulation of goods and services through the community, a huge step from basic cash assistance. The registration of CAV participants outside of the initial issuing groups should be led by the issuing communities and follow the targeting phase where the project team identifies the groups (financial or savings) and individuals within the groups and collects and records relevant information. The field team should ensure that they are capturing the information correctly, which will allow for subsequent follow-ups that are needed as well as facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. The project team should collect the following data at a minimum: demographic and biographic information, location and residency data (using government administrative units) and socioeconomic status (using appropriate metrics such as poverty probability index ( PPI ). Where the CAV will be integrated with another CVA, the project team should liaise with the respective implementers to understand and include the data that will be required for the other projects for efficiency. Key features of the registration process may include: A combination of individual registration, in the case of vendors/goods and service providers who are not part of groups, and group registration, where the project team visits the groups during scheduled meetings and collects the required information. Once beneficiaries are successfully registered, they should receive official confirmation of their registration status through their registered phone numbers, providing the necessary information that includes the purpose for the registration, customer service details in case of any queries, and simplified instructions of how to access and transact with their digital vouchers. Data collection and storage should adhere to local and international standards of data security and protection as well as abide by local legislation governing data collection and use. The logistics for the registration will include the following: Planning for the registration activity by selecting the appropriate registration locations, early communication to the community (and especially target groups and vendors) on dates and locations, preparation of the necessary equipment for the registration team which include identification jackets/labels, mobile devices etc. and organisation of transportation and security logistics. Additional registration sessions can be conducted on a periodic basis in the event that new participants are identified (for instance when new members join a participating group). Recruiting and training a team of local enumerators on the objectives of the project and on how to obtain the required information during data collection. Verification of CAV participant details \u00b6 During registration, the project team should collect data that includes uniquely identifying information such as national identification numbers and phone numbers, which will be needed for digital vouchers. Collecting this information eliminates the possibility of erroneous or duplicate registration and will allow for cross checking for duplication during data cleaning and validation phases before final confirmation of registration. CAV participant database \u00b6 The registration data should be collected electronically using mobile phones or tablets to capitalise on the benefits of data collection, including elimination of transcription errors during data entry where manual/paper data collection is used. All the data that is collected for the project should be stored in a central database that is managed by a core service provider. The database will allow the implementation team to track the progress of the registration (against identified targets), prevent duplicate registration of participants and other controls, and provide for seamless updating of the project information as well as for continuous monitoring and evaluation. Exit Strategy \u00b6 The CAV project design should account for the continuity of community issued CAVs beyond the duration of the support by the implementation team. Key considerations include: Continuous community education \u00b6 Key to the success of continued use and acceptance of CAVs by the users is the continuous education on the objectives of the CAVs, the transaction modalities, and the avenues for conflict resolution. The project should therefore clearly communicate the end of the project supported by the implementation team and identify and build capacity of local CAV champions and the issuing communities who can continue to share information with the community. An additional consideration can entail the creation of easy to understand information, education and communication CAV material that can be used by the community. In Kisauni, for example, an informal settlement near Mombasa town, we found that theatre performances about CAV was the most effective way of communicating certain messages to the community. Note that the legal design around CAVs including the Clearing Union, General Members and Core Service Providers should be well understood by all participants. Also note that these legal structures and agreements need to be supported by local authorities. Sustainability of technical infrastructure \u00b6 Since digital CAVs depend on technical infrastructure such as a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records transactions, accounts and information about CAV users, the availability of this DLT and other micro-services such as wallets, after the exit of the project team is crucial. Working with a Core Service Provider that will provide these systems long term is highly recommended. Continuous stakeholder engagement \u00b6 Through constant engagement from the program design to data collection to monitoring and evaluation, the local stakeholders should be engaged throughout the project timeline. This will encourage stakeholdership and ensure localization is done effectively and respectfully. When an intervention is designed with the community in mind, they take ownership of its success. Capacity building through training of trainers and courses on sustainable agroforestry practises or entrepreneurship will keep Income Generating Activities (IGAs) running and keep the CAV in circulation. Additionally, these IGAs must be constantly _braided _to ensure that they are aware of each other and can easily trade amongst each other. MONITORING AND EVALUATION \u00b6 Monitoring of a CAV project should be a continuous process to provide information and learnings that will enable the project team to iterate, make improvements and course corrections during the implementation phase. Process, output and outcome monitoring \u00b6 CAV usage \u00b6 The primary objective of the monitoring process is to provide visibility on whether the CAV project is meeting the project objectives and whether there is implementation fidelity (i.e. implementation adheres to the project plans). Key questions that the project team can consider when setting up the monitoring framework should focus on understanding: Velocity of transactions. A high frequency of vouchers changing hands between users/vendors signifies increased trade and can potentially indicate an increase in local production. Volume of transactions per user and vendors. While high velocity of transactions is desirable, it is important that these transactions are spread across all CAV users and not just concentrated among a few. Therefore, monitoring average utilisation will enable the project team to identify dormant users, and unpack whether there are any access or other barriers preventing use of CAVs. Transaction activity broken down by demographics. The project team should further unpack voucher use by demographic to see if there are any patterns on utilisation, and especially if a particular demographic (gender, age etc.) is less likely to transact using CAV and therefore develop demographic-specific messaging/interventions to promote uptake. Transaction activity based on commodities. CAVs are intended to promote local production and disaggregating transactions based on the commodities will highlight whether they are primarily used for locally produced goods or goods imported from other markets. Market monitoring \u00b6 The primary goal of monitoring the market is to understand the impact of CAVs on prices and on availability of trace commodities (these can be defined based on goods commonly featured in the participants' minimum expenditure baskets). As such it is important for the project team to monitor price volatility that is caused by use of vouchers to ensure that the CAVs are not causing price distortions in the market. Inflation or other price distortions are of interest not only because of the effect on the ability of CAV users to access the goods and services that they require, but also due to the knock-on effect on non-users which may affect overall productivity in the community. Additionally, the project should also monitor availability of commodities to understand any supply side constraints and whether the CAVs use is limited to a fraction of all trade so that liquidity and cash flow of traders is not distorted, allowing them to restock and continue availing their goods to the market. Spending Journals \u00b6 Spending journals for both CAV users and non-CAV users that detail both CAV usage and national currency usage are a wonderful way to understand the interplay between national currencies and CAVs. If combined with cash transfers the spending journals should show a spike in national currencies pending during a transfer then a subsequent drop when that money leaves the community - as opposed to CAV trade volumes which should rise over time and plateau once they fill the market gaps left by scarce national currency. Baseline, Inline and Endline Surveys and Testimonials \u00b6 Surveys (even by phone) can give an understanding of impacts that are not easily measured economically, such as changes to trust in the community. Testimonials from community members on video can also be collected, this form of communication is the most effective in rural communities. If possible, even having those members present information to new communities would help as well. Evaluation \u00b6 The CAV project team should plan to conduct an impact evaluation during the life of the project, which should be factored in during the design phase. The objectives of the evaluation should be clear and should be based on consultations with stakeholders and be directly linked to wider policy questions. That is, the evaluation should be decision-focussed and will inform policy and strategic decisions by the implementing organisation, donors or the government. Illustrative areas of interest for impact evaluations can include, the impact of CAVs on: Incomes of CAV users, including any differences by gender Trade volumes in the community Household and business debt Availability of goods and services For objectivity, an impact evaluation should be conducted by external evaluators, with clearly defined terms of reference and who have a track record of evaluating cash and other in-kind transfer programs. Dissemination of M&E outputs \u00b6 M&E outputs should be shared both internally within the implementing organisation as well as externally with other stakeholders, including with local authorities. This allows for the sector to more effectively plan for support to communities by ensuring that they are receiving assistance in a structured manner and different projects are not having deleterious effects on other initiatives being implemented. This collaboration will further ensure that there is visibility in all the assistance individual households/communities are benefiting from, allowing the implementing organisation to better utilise their resources, avoid duplication and learn best practises of implementing in-kind and other CVA projects.

What the Toolkit is The PQT is intended to guide the entire end-to-end process of establishing and managing a Community Asset Voucher project (CAV). It outlines the project cycle phases, provides tools and key considerations for each phase as well as highlights potential challenges that were drawn from pilot projects in Kenya. The implementing organisation can use the PQT alongside their programme design documents to enrich and ensure better quality in their planning and implementation by ensuring all important actions are taken at each phase of the project cycle. The PQT also includes a module on monitoring and evaluation, providing resources for the user to undertake appropriate learning with regards to their implementation, thus ensuring iteration and improvement of the programme implementation. What the Toolkit is not The Toolkit is intended as a high-level guidance that organisations implementing CAVs can use to develop and refine their own implementation approaches. It is not a blueprint for all CAV projects as it is developed based primarily on observations and lessons learnt from a CAV project (layered onto CVA programs) in Kenya. As such, due to variations in context, we recommend that the ToolKit is viewed in this light and the guidance herein adapted to the relevant context based on the expertise and experiences of the implementing organisation. There are several ways of making use of this Toolkit.

Preparedness Implementing organisations and partners fully understands and are prepared to implement a CAV program: This module outlines the steps to prepare for implementation of a CAV project, in the different response phases. Vouchers / Ledger system and microservices in place: It highlights the technical and organisational prerequisites for the implementing organisations to undertake a CAV project, for example any institutional arrangements in the event of partnerships between several organisations as well as providing guidance on how an implementing organisation can develop a preliminary understanding of the context. Situation Analysis and Stakeholder Engagement This module outlines the steps required to understand the context in depth through conducting assessment of the households to identify their needs as well as their access to markets. Stakeholders Identification and introduction: An essential step in the success of CAV creation and implementation. This module and accompanying guidebook aims to help Implementing Agencies understand the importance of Stakeholder engagement in all phases of the project. The successful exit strategy from the community depends on a successful stakeholder engagement strategy. Joint Implementation Plan: This module outlines the steps for identifying the beneficiaries and supporting to implement and maintain their CAV, as well as developing strategies to mediate conflicts borne out of CAV use. Screening and baselines: Provide a way to choose successful community groups to issue CAVs and start measuring for impacts. Localization of Materials and CAV/Voucher systems: Effective onboarding of communities will be made easier when information is translated and localised to the community.

The starting point is to understand the level of preparedness for CAV implementation. A comprehensive landscape review and analysis of secondary data to understand the full scope of the response and recovery context for the specific region within a country the users/implementing organisations are operating in. The team should focus on several aspects: history of crises, recovery efforts, community vulnerabilities, government and non-governmental programmes and policies, the legal framework including privacy and data protection issues, coordination mechanisms for responding to crisis or for providing humanitarian assistance, market capacity and dynamics; and level of infrastructure and services. The data can be gathered from government sources for example from publications from national and local governments that include legislations, budgets, relevant policies and strategic plans, standard operating procedures , guidelines and other published literature by development and humanitarian agencies working in the relevant sector. It is essential to understand the level of financial and economic literacy among beneficiaries. This can be done by carrying out surveys (See sample in Appendix) that gauge the communities readiness. These surveys can also be used to identify important information that is necessary for evidence based studies such as RCTs. Volunteers can be trained on conducting the surveys, and on the Data Privacy and Protection policy and procedures (See Appendix) that must be adhered to. Primary data collection and analysis: After the landscape review, the implementing organisation will conduct a workshop with internal stakeholders from the relevant departments (Disaster Management, Finance, Logistics, Innovation Development, etc.) to carry out a self-assessment on the capacity of their organisation to implement a CAV project as they would any CVA program. As such, the process of understanding the preparedness of the organisation will include the following steps: The self-assessment process Main activities Assemble key stakeholders Identify a group of technical, management and support functions Schedule and plan for workshop Secure key stakeholders to participate in the workshop Ensure the workshop facilitator is someone with CAV expertise Conduct workshop Discuss and gain consensus on the assessment scores Graph and present back the assessment scores to the group Propose a range of activities to help strengthen their CAV capacity based on the assessment outcomes Develop Plan of Action (PoA) Prioritise and detail the actions Present the draft PoA to National Society\u2019s leadership for approval Follow-through with PoA by implementing the PoA, incorporating it into internal plans, using it for a funding proposal, etc. Within the workshop, the participants will rank their organisations preparedness across four main thematic areas, namely: Enabling systems Programme tools Resources and capacity Communication and coordination","title":"Organisational preparedness"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#self-assessment-checklist-for-the-cav-implementing-organisation","text":"Do we have the needed staff or Volunteers to support the field operations?

In this section, risks identified across each of the categories should be listed and clearly described, which will include their causes and potential effects on the implementation of a CAV project. In addition, where the project is integrated with other humanitarian programs, the risks of this integration should be described and addressed), separately from the risks of implementing the CBP, which should be analysed separately. Risk management checklist: Social Risk: Once CAV is introduced, is the implementer ready to purchase all the CAV created by a community as an exit strategy? Technical Risk: Should core services fail are there ways for people to access their balances? Are backups of accounts being kept? Regulatory Risk: Is there a risk that the Government will change national legislation about digital assets like vouchers? Political Risk: Are local governments and national governments endorsing CAV creation and usage long term? Exit Strategy: What happens to the record of everyone\u2019s CAV accounts if the system is ever shut down? Can the CAV continue operation once there is no more support? Once the risks have been identified using the above checklist, they should be ranked based on likelihood of occurrence and impact (consequences) on programming once they occur. This ranking can be done using the risk matrix in the appendix. All risks, regardless of their likelihood or impact, should be monitored and addressed during the project cycle, especially where there is potential for risks to increase or decrease during the project. Multiple mitigation strategies can be adopted for each risk, where necessary. Map existing social protection programmes that can be linked to CAVs including assessing readiness and point for convergence. Mapping ongoing assistance programs can help avoid unintentional duplication of work by different agencies and support better integration of CAVs with other assistance programs where this is the appropriate design. Additionally, by highlighting response gaps, it can help in the development of appropriate assistance programmes and provide options for sustainability of CAVs after the exit of the primary implementing organisations by embedding the same within the humanitarian assistance ecosystem. * Mapping assistance programs The following are a list of possible programs that can integrate well into CAV. Income generation Livelihoods Training Cash Transfer Programs * Stakeholder mapping and engagement In addition to mapping the assistance programs, the implementation team should also map the relevant stakeholders who are working at both the national and local level and that may have an influence in the outcome of the project. This will range from relevant government institutions, peer organisations working on CAVs and other community assistance programs, other partners working on other recovery efforts among others. The Stakeholder engagement guide in the appendix provides a template for systematic identification, analysis of influence and development of an engagement strategy (method, channel and frequency). Partnership\u2019s preparedness In some instances, the implementation of CAV projects may involve more than one organisation performing different roles in the project. One way of implementation may entail a humanitarian organisation with community networks that are partnering with an institution that operates and manages the technology anchoring the digital vouchers of the CAV. If the ideal long-term strategy is to transition the technology to the implementing organisation, structures coordinating mechanisms must be established for seamless implementation of the project. Such a collaboration is best guided by a partnership framework with Core Service Providers that outlines key roles and responsibilities, establishes how the partnership and the activities therein will be coordinated including articulating clear communication channels,timelines, financial responsibilities and dispute resolution among other pertinent arrangements (e.g. exit planning). In addition, the partnership should assess the capacity of the payment service provider (similar to the assessment for CAV preparedness) to understand: Services provided and linkages with other relevant technology for instance, whether there will be interlinkage with other CAVs, and how the CAVs will be accessed by users Costs related to operating the CAV technology, institution responsible for those costs, including the costs to the user of CAV Infrastructure requirements including whether the organisation is compliant with data protection laws that may be in place in the country Human resource capacity and requirements, including customer support/complaints handling capacity and whether the capacity is sufficient to support the project","title":"Conduct Benefit and Risk Analysis"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#technological-preparedness","text":"","title":"Technological preparedness"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#technology-setup","text":"Generally the technical setup is done by a local Core Service Provider like Grassroots Economics (The more local the better.)

Interfaces / Wallets: We\u2019ve built custodial systems that enable users to assign guardians that can help them reset lost passwords. Data Sharing: Given the consent of the community, anonymous transaction data can be recorded and displayed The implementing organisation further needs to carry out an assessment of the technological landscape to ensure the requisite infrastructure to support a CAV is available. First, an understanding of the context of the community is important to determine the type of mobile phones being used, including whether the phones are internet ready, internet penetration in the area, and familiarity with mobile money transactions. This will determine whether the primary interaction with the CAV network will be through USSD or web/native mobile applications or through paper vouchers.

Specifically, the assessment will highlight the goods and services that are needed by targeted households, the scale and duration for which these goods are required and the present and anticipated barriers to accessing the same. This assessment will further augment the feasibility study by providing information on whether the community will be able to meet the needs through local production and what role CAVs will play in facilitating access and bridging any identified gaps to meeting the identified needs. The findings of the assessment are critical to the subsequent program design as it will guide the process of generating CAVs as well as determine the value and amount of the CAVs as well as who should receive the CAVs._ _ Objectives and scope of the needs assessment includes: The basic needs to be assessed Geographical areas of interest Affected groups of interest Decisions to be informed To conduct the needs assessment, the implementation team will carry out the following activities: Design and planning for needs assessment. This is a critical step where the implementation team identifies the objectives of the assessment and outlines how these will be met, which will include identifying key activities, stakeholders and resources that will be required. Data collection and analysis Secondary data collection Secondary data will provide the baseline information about the target communities, their priority needs and vulnerabilities and for CAV recovery projects, identifying the impact of socioeconomic shocks on the community (which can be differentiated from systemic/ongoing issues). Based on this information, the implementation team will determine data gaps that require primary data collection. Primary data collection Primary data collection is collected mainly through household interviews and focus group discussion in the target communities. The key steps that the implementation team should undertake are: Seeking requisite approvals : The implementation team should obtain the required approvals, including ethical clearance where necessary, to conduct primary data collection in the community based on the standards and practises of the country of interest. Conducting field work : Design of assessment protocol. A robust data collection protocol to ensure the data collected is valid and representative of the target community is essential. Key features of the data collection protocol include: selection of study sites, application of appropriate sampling strategies, clear identification of objectives, research questions and analytical approach as well as an exploration of ethical considerations. Data collection through household interviews and focus group discussions as has been outlined in the assessment protocol. Further information can be obtained from GEs internal Data protection and sensitivity policy and procedure document, found in the appendix. Analyse collected data to provide information about the community\u2019s needs, barriers to access and preferences of the community for different assistance programmes to mitigate the barriers. Key indicators from the data analysis include: Demographic and socio-economic profile Typical basket of goods and services needed by the community (and their sources within the community) Barriers to access to the prioritised goods and services (ranked by frequency of standard list of barriers such as finances, physical access, reliability etc.) Minimum expenditure basket One of the key objectives of the assessment is to identify the key priority needs of the target population and translate the same into a typical expenditure basket \u2013 food and/or non-food items, and basic and/or livelihoods expenditure, depending on the objective of the response. The implementation team should refer to both primary data collected from the field (e.g., through focus group discussions with community members stratified by income category) as well as secondary data to determine which items should be included in the minimum expenditure basket (MEB). The prioritised basket can then be quantified into local prices which will then inform the process of CAV creation at community level to determine the value and amount of CAVs to be generated and distributed to participants. In the context of CAVs, MEB analysis can provide a basis of determination of the value (pegged to the local currency) and the amount of digital vouchers that will be generated and airdropped in the target community. Where CAVs are implemented alongside other cash assistance programmes, the implementation team should model the proportion of transactions that would be ideal for each type of assistance based on project objectives which include access to services and promoting local trade. For instance, in a context where there is limited local production, or the crisis has severely affected the same necessitating external supplies, a higher proportion of cash assistance can be provided initially to aid in recovery with CAVs introduced in phases once local production has increased. 1. **Resource Mapping** The CAV implementation team carries out resource mapping to gain an understanding of producers and consumers and the productive capacity of goods and services within the CAV target community as well as the supply chain within and into the community. This will highlight whether the challenges in the market are supply side (scarcity) or demand side (lack of money or accessibility) through answering two key questions: Are there goods and services within the community that the potential CAV participants need? Can the market respond to changes in demand occasioned by introduction and use of CAVs by the community? Understanding the capacity of the market to meet demand and any access barriers will influence programme design by informing how the CAV will work for traders, service providers and other community members and whether there will be an effect on the prices for both CAV users and other members of the community. Key areas that the market assessment will evaluate include whether there is: A functioning market, where the potential CAV members can trade their goods and services Capacity for local production Knowledge gaps that can be easily filled through trainings Source of goods routinely traded in the market including clear supply and resupply modalities Availability of traders that can exchange with each other and have the capacity to produce goods locally. Price stability, including seasonal effects Geographical accessibility of shops/markets to targeted CAV participants Taxation regime in place and its impact on final prices of goods and services Mobile and internet availability to facilitate transactions across targeted CAV participants Needs and market assessment should be conducted routinely throughout the project lifecycle. The implementation team should incorporate aspects of these assessment in routine M&E activities to have a continuous understanding how introduction of CAV has affected the needs as well as monitor prices and uptake of select goods and services to understand whether CAVs have had a negative impact on the same through price distortions or inflation. For a digital CAV a CSP will provide anonymous transactional data updated regularly that show how the CAV is circulating or stagnating. This transaction data is crucial for understanding the success of the project.","title":"Needs assessment"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#assessment-checklist-for-cav-issuing-groups","text":"Does the group trade among yourselves already in national currency or in-kind?

Volunteers train the group and the group is enabled to create their own CAV redeemable for their own goods and services. The group also begins to trade this CAV with people outside their group. After months of trading, the Implementing organisation receives a call from a Volunteer alerting them on the gamification taking place in the savings group. The members are simply trading back and forth to show they are using it but aren\u2019t exchanging goods and services. Also CAV holders outside the group that have accepted it find they can\u2019t redeem it for anything from the group. The group in question didn\u2019t really have goods or services to offer, nor did they have table banking procedures or even weekly contributions or meetings. The process of targeting should be participatory and collaborative, involving various stakeholders working on humanitarian and other assistance programs to allow for transparency, build the trust of the community and avoid duplication of efforts and assistance, which may negate the intention of CAVs. As a corollary to this collaborative approach, the implementation team should initiate and maintain clear communication throughout the project implementation to pre-empt any misunderstanding around why some groups/households are included in the project and others are not, thus reducing the risk of hostility or resistance of the project by non-participating community members. As such, the objectives of the project should be clearly articulated for both the stakeholders as well as the community. Additionally, the implementation team should develop, maintain and share with stakeholders (including local government officials) a list of clear (and ideally, replicable) criteria that it will use for targeting beneficiaries for the CAV project. The implementation team should also account for additional factors that will influence the targeting process, including: striking a balance between administrative ease and costs and the political acceptability within the community.","title":"Targeting"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#geographical-targeting","text":"As highlighted in Module 3, CAVs are targeted in communities with an accessible market, with both vendors and consumers who have capacity to produce and participate in trade. Therefore, when targeting communities for a CAV project, proximity of the market(s) and other goods and services that will be traded using CAV to beneficiaries is a primary consideration, including ease of access to the identified market. The implementation team should identify the target community using through a series of (non-sequential) steps that may entail: review of secondary data, consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders, and analysis of market assessment data collected by the team, including analysis of administrative maps for an understanding of boundaries and settlement patterns. Identification of a singular community with clear delineation of boundaries in an urban setting may be especially challenging in informal settlements, where the populations are fluid and markets as well as other amenities and services are shared across areas. Subsequent beneficiary targeting will further strengthen the geographical targeting as community groups (see 4.1.2) are more likely to have close ties and frequent interactions that may transcend borders and alleviate these urban challenges.","title":"Geographical targeting"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#beneficiary-targeting","text":"CAVs should be implemented in communities with strong community groups, particularly those that are involved in some form of income generation, or informal financial/saving groups that bring together members to save and invest.

As a start, the establishment of a broad criteria that can be adopted to various contexts can be considered. For instance, cut-off points can be established to help determine which households or groups will be included: e.g., households owning more than a set number of assets (livestock, household assets etc.) or households earning more than a certain income threshold per month.","title":"Targeting criteria"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#transparency-stakeholder-involvement-and-harmonisation-with-other-assistance-programmes","text":"CAVs can also be used as precursors to other assistance programmes, as it can provide data allowing other CVA projects to better target aid.

For instance, where the aim of the assistance is to meet individual needs during an emergency, a less stringent criteria can be applied to target a wider proportion of the community, whereas in a recovery setting, targeting based on socio-economic, contextual and other factors will better enable the CAV and other CVAs to meet their objectives.","title":"Transparency, stakeholder involvement and harmonisation with other assistance programmes"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#implementation","text":"","title":"IMPLEMENTATION"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#local-sensitization","text":"","title":"Local Sensitization"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#trainers-of-trainers-tots","text":"Before engaging with local stakeholders or community groups it is important to work with ToTs.

In preparation for the CAV creation process, the project team, together with the local authorities and other stakeholders should conduct a sensitization of the community ahead of the CAV creation process to create awareness of the activity and reduce any misunderstanding that may cause tension in the community. The team can leverage on established events such as community meetings and clearly communicate the objectives and target participants. The community entry should be conducted in two stages: first, with local community stakeholders on CiC and subsequently, through a community entry meeting with a broader community/community groups to introduce the concept, objectives and benefits of CAVs. The project team should coordinate with other stakeholders for a smooth rollout of the process to avoid scheduling conflicts and to promote optimal participation. Additionally, the team should liaise with local authorities, informing them of the program activity for a smooth community entry and assurance of the necessary security where needed.

This will determine the number of Vouchers that the group should generate. This amount should account for both the minimum expenditure basket at household level as well as the volume of trade/transactions expected between community group members, while factoring in the overall objectives of the CAV project. To ensure liquidity, ability to restock as well as to meet the objective of boosting local trade, the value of vouchers should be pegged on the total production potential of the targeted groups. Ensure that a maximum of 12% of a group's committed annual sales capacity is used to guarantee redemptions for the created CAVs. This means that there is always more than enough goods and services in value compared to the vouchers issued (overcollateralization). Therefore, the community groups and other stakeholders will determine the supply of vouchers generated per group as above, how that amount varies within different groups within the community (based on their production capacity), and how the vouchers will be disbursed.

It is crucial that the design of the mechanism for resolving conflict is entrenched in existing platforms at community level to ensure acceptability by members and to foster sustainability beyond the lifespan of the project. The implementation team must proactively help community groups establish this mechanism so that members know of its existence and function and use it for the intended purpose. Additionally, since the mediators may not be part of the CAV project, the implementation team should conduct in-depth sensitization to ensure understanding of the project objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria and general functioning of the CAV as a medium of exchange.","title":"Conflict resolution"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#community-mobilisation","text":"Note that without any intervention the CAVs created by the community will enter the larger population through trade. Freely offering the vouchers to the rest of the community who are not committed to redemption themselves would lead to the issuing group becoming insolvent. The CAVs, as vouchers with guaranteed redemption by the issuing group, should be used productively by the issuing group. They can be traded for labour, sold and so on. Should the issuing group decide to donate them to support elderly, they should be hailed as an example of a social enterprise. Each member of an issuing group should enrol 3 to 5 more people in the community to accept them as payment, while knowing they can be redeemed by the issuing group for goods and services (not national currency).","title":"Community Mobilisation"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#cav-use","text":"As outlined in the previous module, the project implementation team will work with the community groups and other stakeholders to determine the supply of vouchers generated. Once the vouchers are generated, the community issuing groups should be notified of their allocations and how to transact using the vouchers amongst the group members and with other voucher recipients within their community. To stimulate circulation of CAVs within the community, the CAV design should disincentive hoarding through a demurrage (a reduction in value of the vouchers by a defined proportion if the CAV remains unused for a specified period). Users of CAVs should be well educated on the demurrage, which should be public and acceptable by the community. This further serves the objectives of the CAV project \u2013 to stimulate local trade by guaranteeing a certain level of transactions. * Capacity Development and Cash and Voucher Assistance Programs While so far this PQT has focused on helping communities develop CAVs, Humanitarian organisations also have several options for interacting with CAVs in order to support target populations for immediate relief and long term development: Capacity Building: When identifying resources that people have to share \u2013 gaps in those resources compared to need often arise. Filling these gaps through training and asset development can help the community have a solid framework for voucher redemption. They can invest in developing more income generating activities within the community. For example, they could buy a maize mill, or provide business training to the group members in order to improve their ability to generate income with their latent capacity. This can increase the amount of CAVs that the community can redeem and hence issue. Evidence based support: If there is sufficient capacity and enough CAVs, they can buy CAVs from the groups (as they would any Voucher), either from the communal pots or from the members themselves, and redistribute those vouchers out to the broader community as in a CVA program. They are effectively pre-buying the goods and services of the members within the group, and allowing for the broader community to have access to goods and services that they didn\u2019t have money for before. Rather than providing cash, which would quickly leave the community, the vouchers ensure a local circulation of currency, and a boost to local trade. Indexing: Data from CAV circulation and endorsements from validators is indexed based on Sustainable Development Goals and a rank and reward can be calculated for support Donor Support: Donors can be rewarded with SDG impact data in the form of a certificate they can also follow up on future impacts. Treasuries: Based on results from Indexing a Humanitarian organisation can choose to purchase vouchers with donor funds (held in Treasuries). Redistribution: Based on results from Indexing CAVs held in Treasuries can be redistributed directly to those people in need. This is similar to a Cash and Voucher Assistance program but with the vouchers coming from the local community. Providing aid in this way, to the communities, has allowed for higher volumes and more sustainable circulation of goods and services through the community, a huge step from basic cash assistance. The registration of CAV participants outside of the initial issuing groups should be led by the issuing communities and follow the targeting phase where the project team identifies the groups (financial or savings) and individuals within the groups and collects and records relevant information. The field team should ensure that they are capturing the information correctly, which will allow for subsequent follow-ups that are needed as well as facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. The project team should collect the following data at a minimum: demographic and biographic information, location and residency data (using government administrative units) and socioeconomic status (using appropriate metrics such as poverty probability index ( PPI ). Where the CAV will be integrated with another CVA, the project team should liaise with the respective implementers to understand and include the data that will be required for the other projects for efficiency. Key features of the registration process may include: A combination of individual registration, in the case of vendors/goods and service providers who are not part of groups, and group registration, where the project team visits the groups during scheduled meetings and collects the required information. Once beneficiaries are successfully registered, they should receive official confirmation of their registration status through their registered phone numbers, providing the necessary information that includes the purpose for the registration, customer service details in case of any queries, and simplified instructions of how to access and transact with their digital vouchers. Data collection and storage should adhere to local and international standards of data security and protection as well as abide by local legislation governing data collection and use. The logistics for the registration will include the following: Planning for the registration activity by selecting the appropriate registration locations, early communication to the community (and especially target groups and vendors) on dates and locations, preparation of the necessary equipment for the registration team which include identification jackets/labels, mobile devices etc. and organisation of transportation and security logistics. Additional registration sessions can be conducted on a periodic basis in the event that new participants are identified (for instance when new members join a participating group). Recruiting and training a team of local enumerators on the objectives of the project and on how to obtain the required information during data collection.","title":"CAV use"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#verification-of-cav-participant-details","text":"During registration, the project team should collect data that includes uniquely identifying information such as national identification numbers and phone numbers, which will be needed for digital vouchers.

An additional consideration can entail the creation of easy to understand information, education and communication CAV material that can be used by the community. In Kisauni, for example, an informal settlement near Mombasa town, we found that theatre performances about CAV was the most effective way of communicating certain messages to the community.

A high frequency of vouchers changing hands between users/vendors signifies increased trade and can potentially indicate an increase in local production. Volume of transactions per user and vendors. While high velocity of transactions is desirable, it is important that these transactions are spread across all CAV users and not just concentrated among a few. Therefore, monitoring average utilisation will enable the project team to identify dormant users, and unpack whether there are any access or other barriers preventing use of CAVs. Transaction activity broken down by demographics. The project team should further unpack voucher use by demographic to see if there are any patterns on utilisation, and especially if a particular demographic (gender, age etc.) is less likely to transact using CAV and therefore develop demographic-specific messaging/interventions to promote uptake.

Inflation or other price distortions are of interest not only because of the effect on the ability of CAV users to access the goods and services that they require, but also due to the knock-on effect on non-users which may affect overall productivity in the community. Additionally, the project should also monitor availability of commodities to understand any supply side constraints and whether the CAVs use is limited to a fraction of all trade so that liquidity and cash flow of traders is not distorted, allowing them to restock and continue availing their goods to the market.","title":"Market monitoring"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#spending-journals","text":"Spending journals for both CAV users and non-CAV users that detail both CAV usage and national currency usage are a wonderful way to understand the interplay between national currencies and CAVs.

Team members are discouraged from bringing large amounts of cash or other personal valuables to work unless absolutely necessary. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from team members. Those with ideas, concerns or suggestions for improved safety and security in the workplace are encouraged to bring them to management\u2019s attention so that the safety and welfare of all team members can be improved. Team members should feel free to report, without fear of retaliation, any condition which they believe poses a safety, health or security risk in the workplace. The Implementing agency will investigate such reports promptly and thoroughly and take appropriate corrective action. Further, any comments or jokes regarding threats of violence will be taken seriously, and dealt with appropriately and promptly. Each team member is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Team members must immediately report any unsafe condition to their supervisor. Team members who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, who fail to report where appropriate, or fail to remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including separation.

A group of service providers (tomato sellers, school teachers, hairdressers and so on) come together to create a commons centered around their services. Please see the glossary of terms and contact us for more information. Awareness \u00b6 Workshops : Meetings with regional and local stakeholders to explain the CIC concept and answer all questions. These workshops should be done yearly and when stakeholders change (such as a new administration or area chief comes in). Training \u00b6 Intro : Group introductions, setting of intentions (prayers), historical overview and introducing the CIC concept. Resource Mapping : Working with your community to map out resources and needs. Often people don\u2019t realize how much they can offer and how much they can support each-other. The Training guide goes through the majority of these steps. Also note that individuals and organizations like the Red Cross or Core Service providers can create their own vouchers redeemable for goods or services. Learning through games : Ensure that everyone involved or expected to utilize a CIC is able to play through a demonstration with others. Work out all the kinks BEFORE you start. The bean game in our Community Training Guide works well to demonstrate and help the community build their own CIC design. Ending with the thread game helps visualize the commons of service being formed Registration : Becoming a member of the Grassroots Economic Commons and creating an account on the Sarafu-Network platform. Here we show people how to use the digital interface to create their account. They will automatically get some Sarafu (SRF) vouchers which they can use as a learning tool and later redeem in order to make their own vouchers. Also we go over password setting, social account recovery, editing profile information, and trading. Voucher Declaration : Here we go over the form that must be filled to create a voucher and create a demonstration. Member Commitments : Coming up with agreements on what each member of the community can offer to the whole in exchange for the vouchers they are creating together. Final demo-game : We play through the bean game one more time - including the concept of a community fund that fills with expired vouchers. Leaving forms : The voucher declaration forms are left with the group to complete. Note that our Community Training Guide gives a basic training for identifying local resources and sharing them together using a voucher. Support Creation and Audit \u00b6 Follow-ups : to help the group with any questions. Audits, Endorsements and Conflict Mitigation : Commitments should be internally audited by the community and as well with a designated auditor to ensure that the vouchers can be redeemed in a reasonable amount of time. A mediator should be assigned to deal with conflicts, like when a member spends but refuses to redeem vouchers they created. Agreements Signed In order to issue their own CIC, the group needs to enter into three agreements, in this order: A Economic Commons Agreement: this is an agreement every member must agree to before the creation of their Voucher. It is effectively a terms and conditions of the full ecosystem. A Voucher Declaration / Membership Agreement: an agreement exists between the members of the group, and ensures that: They\u2019ve identified a common unit of account, (1 Voucher = 1 Egg) They\u2019ve identified and quantified their commitments /offerings to each other, using their chosen unit of account. They\u2019ve all been audited and verified on their commitments/offerings, by the service provider chiefs/elders/chairpersons/local governance. They\u2019ve agreed on the total supply/quantity of vouchers to be issued, matched to their commitments, and have named their voucher. They\u2019ve agreed to accept the vouchers for their goods and services. They\u2019ve set limits to how many vouchers they can receive for their goods and services within a day/week/month/year, to ensure that they never receive more than they are able to spend (ensuring movement of vouchers). They set a group issuance limit on the vouchers , to ensure that the amount of vouchers created matches the redeemable goods and services. They\u2019ve agreed to, and elected a means of mediation/arbitration in case there is a fault. They\u2019ve agreed on a gradual expiration of the vouchers to ensure that the voucher is not hoarded, but traded (demurrage). Because groups don't want their vouchers to be lost forever in the hands of collectors/hoarders, they ensure that they expire slowly over time at ~2% a month - and return to their group accounts. This means that anyone holding 100 Vouchers will lose 2 of them from their account each month. These amounts in the community funds of the groups can be used for projects and supporting the needy. They\u2019ve agreed on any savings/voucher-pooling mechanisms within the group, and what that savings will be used for. A Service Agreement: this is an agreement with a Core Service Provider such as Grassroots Economics Foundation around training, arbitration of disputes, instrument creation, data handling and technical platform access & maintenance (access to the core ledger, wallet, phone support etc). Minting / Voucher Creation : This is generally handled by a Core Service Provider like Grassroots Economics, who will validate the group's commitments, audits and endorsements and deploy a contract on a ledger that is visible to anyone. This contract (smart contract) will hold all the relevant information about the Voucher and create the supply. Initial Voucher Distribution : After minting, Vouchers will then be distributed to the issuing community that has committed to redeeming them with full transparency. This will be done as per the instructions of the Voucher Declaration and can be facilitated by a community treasurer. It is recommended to have a voted on community fund /treasury which will also collect any levies (demurrage or expired vouchers). Review and Launch Preparation \u00b6 Review : Refresher on how CICs work and making sure everyone in the group is in alignment. Chama book : The voucher issuing group should have regular meeting where they record everyone's balances and seek to reach balance of trade. Marketing Materials : Placards that tell people how to trade with their voucher are distributed to members. Social Fabric : Mapping out the members and their connections to each other on a fabric. Launch Preparation : Launch planning included, stakeholders, announcements, a schedule of the event, setting up a local market, theater, offerings to local elders and leaders, speeches, displaying the unit of account. People not in the issuing group should be invited to accept the vouchers for their goods and services and to also shown how to register on the network. Launching and Continued Support \u00b6 Greater Community Outreach : While the community of issuers may begin to assign and clear vouchers among each other, they will generally want to spread their usage to their greater community. They can choose to give new users a small amount out of their community fund as is done with Sarafu, or to simply try to sell the Vouchers or use them to buy goods or services. We call this process 'braiding' of bringing more and more users into the network. Long Term Maintenance : Imbalance / inequality is a common character of any credit system. Some people may end up with a lot and some people may end up with zero. Having regular meetings, or market days and actively clearing imbalances together is highly recommended. A levy on accounts is a good way to ensure that people have no incentive to hold Vouchers as a form of savings or investment and that they continue to circulate as a medium of exchange.","title":"Voucher Creation"},{"location":"ops/voucher/#voucher-cic-creation","text":"This is a summary of a group Voucher creation process.

Massively scalable \u00b6 The queueing and syncing engine should be able to queue and sync state change requests and state queries to the full capacity of the integrated networks, without any loss of data and with minimum middleware latency for the end-user. Avoid lock-ins \u00b6 .. whether by opacity, complexity or license terms. No part of the system should rely on and/or integrate with libraries or services that cannot be reasonably understood and/or adapted. Nor should the work required to replace a component be unreasonable large as a result of external dependencies. It should also be straightforward for services implementers to choose their own services dependencies (like chains, chain nodes, SaaS deferrals etc). Lean dependency graph \u00b6 The base components should make use of primitives and standard libraries as much as possible. The services components written for Grassroots Economics specifically should only rely on generic base components. Network state as the source of truth \u00b6 Changes to state is sent to network immediately. State queries made through the engine always retrieve state from network before being adjusted. Split engine into reusable modules \u00b6 Which in essence is practical implementation of the \"system parts\" chapter below. No soft lock-in to virtual environments \u00b6 Too many modern software projects only provides reasonable ease of use through mechanisms like Docker or similar frameworks. Care should be taken to incur minimum penalty for using the application and tooling in a local host environment. Documentation must exist and be maintained to facilitate this. Furthermore, there should exist local-only alternate services of the underlying base components. Example of this is the chaind / chaind-eth pair which enables queue/sync dynamics in a local services (e.g. systemd) environment for an independent wallet. Coherent configurations regardless of entry-point \u00b6 Merged ini-format configuration files constitute configuration schemas and overrides, translating to a configuration directive vocabulary overridable by environment variables of the same name. CLI tooling framework \u00b6 Layered definitions of command line arguments, so that concepts common for each layer is only defined in one place. Full and intuitive control of overriding configuration directives with command line arguments and flags.
